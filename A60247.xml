            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For, that we may not fall into the errour of the Anabaptiſts, there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to be made betwixt a Cuſtom
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54276:9"/>that happened but accidentally in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and continued not there long, and a Divine Law, which can never be diſpenſed with. No other Law obliged Believers to it at that time, but the Law of Charity; and we are at preſent under the ſame obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, ſeeing the goods which we poſſeſs, become in ſome manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to our Brethren, when they fall into neceſſity and want. The Apoſtles were not ignorant of the Laws which <hi>Moſes</hi> made in favour of the Poor, to prevent their being reduced to beggary. And in that ſenſe we ought to explain the words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi>
               <note n="(1)" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Pſal. 37.25.</note> 
               <hi>I have not ſeen the Righteous forſaken, nor his ſeed begging Bread.</hi> Where we are to obſerve that the <hi>Jews</hi> took to themſelves the name of <hi>Righteous,</hi> to diſtinguiſh themſelves from other Nations that Worſhipped Idols. The Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> contain many Laws which oblige the Rich, on ſeveral occaſions, to make their goods common to the Poor, and one of the chief is the Law that prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits the exacting of Uſury from their Brethren. And that Law is ſtill in force among them, in the low condition to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54276:9"/>which they now are reduced, they being perſwaded, that that charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Brethren, is of divine right. We are not then to inquire into any other cauſe of that Community of goods which was in uſe, in the Infancy of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, but the Laws of Charity, which are ſtill the ſame, though the practice of them differ according to the diverſity of occaſions. For ſeeing the Primitive Believers lived in Society, &amp; that there were a great many poor among them, thoſe who had eſtates were obliged to ſell them, to ſupply the neceſſities of their Brethren.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles conformed exactly to the Cuſtom which was already eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Synagogues. They made a gathering on the days of their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, in imitation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and during the week every one laid up what he could, to be delivered to thoſe who took the care of collecting their Alms. In the places where Chriſtians met, there were<note n="(1)" place="margin">Tertul. in Apolog.</note> Boxes, as well as in the Synagogues, for receiving the Alms of private perſons, and the money was diſtributed amongſt the Poor, the Orphans, Widows, and Sick.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54276:10"/>Now this diſtribution was not made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently by every one that pleaſed: But as in the Synagogues, there were Officers entruſted with that care, ſo likewiſe the Apoſtles appointed Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, or Miniſters, to whom they gave the ſame Commiſſion, reſerving to themſelves, nevertheleſs, the chief direction and overſight thereof. In a word, if we conſult the Jewiſh Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the preſent practice of their Synagogues, as to what concerns their Charity, we ſhall find that the Apoſtles have exactly followed their Diſcipline in that particular. They ſtill ſend their Alms to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to other places in <hi>Judea,</hi> for the relief of the Poor that live in thoſe parts: And beſides the conſtant Charity that they give in the Towns where they live, to thoſe that are in want, they aſſiſt Forreign <hi>Jews,</hi> who make application to them, in their neceſſity; and for Proof of this, it would ſuffice to ſhew a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate ſigned by their <hi>Rabbies,</hi> after the ſame manner, as Letters of Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, were granted to Believers in the Firſt Ages of the Church; which gave <hi>Lucian</hi> occaſion to ſay, that to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54276:10"/>become rich in a ſhort time, there needed no more but to pretend to be a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>At that time the Miniſters of the Church had no other Revenues,<note place="margin">The firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the Church.</note> but what they gathered from the Charity of believers: For as to Tithes, Firſt-fruits, and other Rights that belonged to the Levites and Prieſts, they were abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with the Sacrifice. Our Saviour having inſtituted a new form of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, appointed alſo a new way of providing for the neceſſities of the new Miniſters. He received the Alms that were given him, and put them into the cuſtody of a Steward, to be diſtributed according as need did require. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſpeaks often in his Epiſtles of the duty of Miniſters towards the people, and of the people towards their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſays no more, but conform to the words of our Saviour, that they who preach the Goſpel, ſhould alſo live by the Goſpel, and that they who ſerve at the Altar, ſhould participate of that which is offered upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; thereby alluding to the Offerings of the Old Teſtament He never makes mention of Tithes, nor of thoſe Dues
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54276:11"/>that were given to the Prieſts, becauſe he ſuppoſes that, that Prieſthood being aboliſhed, the rights that from thence accrued to the Prieſts, ought likewiſe to be abrogated. And therefore, the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, who ſold their eſtates, for the relief of the Poor, and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their Miniſters, thought it not ſufficient to beſtow the tenth part, but freely gave all that was neceſſary, knowing that the right of Tithes and Firſt-fruits, were but only Ceremonies, and Cuſtoms of the Old Teſtament; of which they retained no more, but what concerned Morality. So that Charity was the Rule of what they were to give to the Miniſters of the Goſpel. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> who hath made ſeveral good Regulations, concerning the Adminiſtration of theſe Alms, calls the Portion that was given to the Prieſts and Widows, <hi>Honoraries.</hi> This he doth, when he recommends to <hi>Timothy,</hi>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54276:12"/>theſe Aſſemblies, had the ſame ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as the Ruler of the Synagogue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> had in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues. The Superiority of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Synagogue, in reſpect of the Prieſts or Elders, conſiſted only in ſome Titles of honour, as being the Chief amongſt their Brethren. And therefore they are all comprehended under the name of Prieſts or Elders in the Hundred and ſeventh <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where we have theſe words:<note n="(1)" place="margin">

               <hi>Let them alſo exalt him in the Congregation of the People, and praiſe him in the Aſſembly of the Elders;</hi> which was the place of their Meetings. So we find in the New Teſtament, that the names of Prieſt and Biſhop are indifferently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the one for the other; and that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly or Council of the Elders, which was called <hi>Presbyterium,</hi> conſiſted of the Biſhop, and the Prieſts or Elders. The Biſhop, or Preſident, as the Ancient Fathers ſpeak, had indeed the chief Direction or Superintendency; from whence he was called Biſhop. which word is alſo found in the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Septuagint or Helleniſts, but he made up but one Body with the Elders
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54276:12"/>or Prieſts, who in Quality of Judges, had their Juriſdiction jointly with him. Hence we may infer that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Church, the management of affairs, and the Juriſdiction which is now called Epiſcopal, did not depend on the Biſhop alone, no more than the diſtribution of the Offerings, but on the whole Senate or Aſſembly of the Prieſts; and this continued ſo long as there was but one Church in every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, one Altar, and one Conſiſtory of Prieſts joined to their Biſhop, becauſe it was not eaſy then, for the Biſhop to become Maſter of the whole Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and Adminiſtration of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues. But ſo ſoon as it was neceſſary to encreaſe the number of Churches,<note place="margin">The Original of the great Authority of Biſhops.</note> there was ſome cauſe to fear, leſt thoſe who governed the new Churches, might attribute to themſelves the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Biſhops, finding themſelves at the head of a particular Church.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54276:13"/>take upon them the Government of the new erected Churches, which were called <hi>Titles.</hi> St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſtrongly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains this opinion in his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> where he affirms that before this divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, each Church was governed by the Common Councel of the Prieſts; but that for avoiding all occaſion of Schiſm, one of theſe Prieſts or Elders was choſen to be the Chief, and to take upon him the care of the whole Church. He pretends that the names of Prieſt and Biſhop did not at all differ in the beginning, and that therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> made uſe of them indifferently: Then he ſubjoyns,<note n="(1)" place="margin">Epiſcopi noverint ſe, magis conſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudine, quam diſpoſitionis do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicae verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, Presbyteris eſſe majores.

None but the Weſtern Church hath put the Eſtates of the Church into Titles and Livings, in the ſame manner as if private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were the abſolute maſters of thoſe Eſtates.</p>

Otherwiſe he muſt have gone againſt the Ancient Canons, which leave Church-men at liberty to diſpoſe of their own Eſtates as they pleaſe. It is true theſe Canons were made in the Eaſtern Church, where moſt of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54276:20"/>Biſhops having been Married before their Election, had Wives and Children to provide for; and where Prieſts and Deacons might Marry if they pleaſed.

               </note> renewed in the Church of the Weſt, though they had not the ſame reaſons for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Church-men were only prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to bequeath by Will, the Goods which they had got in their Livings, becauſe Believers did not give to Churches, only to enrich the Church-men. If it happened, nevertheleſs, that the Biſhop died without making a Will, and had no heirs, then did the Church ſucceed to all his Eſtate. The Churches of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had got a <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation of the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Canons, imitated the cuſtoms of that Church, which were likewiſe propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in other Churches of the Weſt.

There was this difference,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the Ancient and Modern Monks.</note> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, betwixt the firſt Monks that were in <hi>Europe</hi> before St. <hi>Benet,</hi> and thoſe that came after him, that the firſt were barely Monks, without being addicted to any particular Order. To be a Monk was ſufficient, to make them received as ſuch, in all Monaſteries whereſoever they travelled. There was no talk then of particular Rules and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions But every Monk laboured to emprove himſelf by the example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to embrace what he thought moſt perfect in the Monaſtick life. So that, it may be ſaid, that the Monks both of the Eaſt and Weſt were all of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54276:27"/>one Order, having at that time no Mark of diſtinction amongſt them. The ancient Rules that have been written by the Primitive Monks, ought rather to be lookt upon as different Commentaries upon the Monaſtick life, than different Rules; for the intention of thoſe who embraced that kind of life, was not to diſtinguiſh themſelves by particular Rules from the manner of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iving of other men, but to ſubmit themſelves by a more particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to the Maxims of the Goſpel, and to find out all poſſible ways how they might live up to the Counſels of our Saviour, who will have us to wean our hearts altogether from the World, that we may follow him alone who is above it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here ſpeak of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of St. <hi>Benet,</hi> which is in the hands of every body; but ſhall only obſerve by the by, that the deſign of that Saint was not to make any inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in the Monaſtick life, but to make a Collection of what he found moſt perfect in the Rules and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of others. Matters are much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſince. All the ſeveral Orders of Monks make now a days ſo many
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54276:28"/>petty different Republicks in the Church, and are ſo many little States who have all their ſeveral intereſts. But let us now return to our Subject concerning the Original and Progreſs of the Revenues of the Church.</p>
            <p>No ſooner were the Barbarous Kings become Maſters of a part of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire,<note place="margin">Changes in Church and State.</note> but the Civil and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Laws ſuffered great alterations. There was a neceſſity of complying with the humor and temper of theſe new Conquerours, who medled in the affairs of the Church. There was not now, as formerly, the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in electing of Biſhops. Prince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thought of ſecuring their States, by conferring Biſhopricks only on ſuch as they could rely upon. So that Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical dignities began to be looks upon, as mere Lay-Offices, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of Princes, with which they could Reward thoſe that ſerved them. And which was more pernicious to the Church, Princes and other great Lords began to make no more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt goods conſecrated to God, and goods Profane. The neceſſity of the times muſt be born with; and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54276:28"/>the great Wars that Princes were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in, was the cauſe that the beſt part of the Revenues of the Church, fell into the hands of Lay-men.<note place="margin">The Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Church in the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as temporal Eſtates.</note>They made Contracts of Alienation about them, as about other Poſſeſſions; and theſe Contracts paſt for lawful, when they were made in the uſual forms. No body oppoſed it. The Biſhops &amp; Monks treated often with Laicks about thoſe concerns, either by way of Exchange or Purchaſe. The ancient <hi>Cartularies</hi> or Regiſters of the Monks are full of ſuch kinds of Contracts; wherein it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that Children ſucceeded to their Fathers as well in Church livings, as in other Eſtates. The Counts or Judges decided the differences that aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt private perſons about ſuch Eſtates, in the ſame manner as about other Inheritances and Poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>It is true ſome ſcrupulous People made a Diſtinction betwixt Altars and Churches;<note place="margin">A diſtinctio betwixt Churches an Altars.</note> comprehending under the name of Churches, Lands, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Revenues for which men might contract; and aſſigning a Prieſt to the Altar, who was to have a Salary for ſaying Maſs and performing other
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54276:29"/>Eccleſiaſtical Functions. But ſome who were not ſo ſcrupulous made no ſuch imaginary diſtinction. For in the ancient <hi>Cartularies</hi> there are to be found forms of deeds of alienation of Churches and Altars, with the Bells, Chalices, Croſſes and other Ornaments of the Church. This was practiſed even in <hi>Italy,</hi> before the Popes entred into the cogniſance of the goods of the Churches, which depended not on their Dioceſe. To theſe troubleſome times we may attribute the total Ruine of private Church men,<note place="margin">The Ruine of private Church-men.</note> who were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take wages from thoſe who poſſeſſed the Churches. And which is more unhappy, the greateſt part of thoſe Revenues are fallen into the poſſeſſion of Cathedral Churches and Monaſteries, to which they did not at all belong. The truth is there are forms of Contracts to be found in the ſame <hi>Cartularies,</hi> which make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that Monks have bought ſeveral Churches from Lay-men; but part of theſe Churches had been uſurped by the Laicks from the Church-men, to whom they ought to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and not ſold to the Monks.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:54276:29"/>
            <p>When the adminiſtrations of Church Revenues were erected into Benefices, or perpetual Titles, the Church-Men who were hired by the Chapters of Cathedral Churches, by the Monks, and even by Laicks, became perpetual Vicars and Curats. But the beſt part of the Benefices remained ſtill to the Canons and Monks, who took to themſelves afterward the Quality of Primitive Curates. Beſides, ſince pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men were not able, Princes and other great men bought the Churches from thoſe Church-Men, and gave them to the Monks, who entertained Secular Prieſts, to take the care of adminiſtring the Sacraments to the People; all the Revenue and Tithes in the mean time remaining to the Monaſteries. Wherefore, it will not be amiſs to explain in this place more particularly, the Original and Progreſs of the Revenues annexed to Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and at the ſame time to ſpeak of their priviledges and exemptions. A great part of what we ſhall ſay of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, being alſo applicable to other Eccleſiaſticks.</p>
            <p>We have ſhown before, that Monks
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54276:30"/>having made profeſſion of poverty,<note place="margin">The Original of Lands and other Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Monaſteries.</note> lived only by their labour, and the Alms they received as being poor. And ſince they were not employed in Eccleſiaſtical Functions, they could not apply to themſelves theſe words of St. <hi>Paul, They which wait at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar.</hi> And therefore it ſeems they ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to pretend to the enjoyment of Church Revenues, which according to Natural &amp; Evangelical Law, belong to none but the Miniſters of the Church. The contrary notwithſtanding hath come to paſs; For moſt part of Church-Men have been deprived of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues that belonged to them, and the Monks endowed therewith. It hath been already obſerved that Monks ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves much to Prayer, and that that got them the Charity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny private perſons. But ſince Biſhops allowed them to have Oratories or Churches for their own uſe, this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was doubled and People began to leave their Pariſh Churches, and flock to their Chappels. Nay there were ſome Monks that made Fonts in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, in the ſame manner as there
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54276:30"/>are in Baptiſmal Churches. The Biſhops did, indeed, forbid them to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter any Sacraments, but to thoſe of their Monaſtery, and denied them Baptiſmal Churches. But though they were at that time ſubject to them in all things, even in what concerned the Monaſtick Diſcipline, yet it was not in their Power to hinder the People from giving them Charity. There were, nevertheleſs, ſome Biſhops who would have reduced them to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the Ancient Canons, and not ſuffered them to have Prieſts among them: But Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> who was favourable to the Monks, wrote in their behalf to one of his Suffragans, that he ſhould permit them to Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate Maſs in their Monaſtery;<note place="margin">The Original of private Maſſes.</note> and that was chiefly the Original of private Maſſes, which have been very uſeful to the Monks, and bring at preſent ſome profit to moſt Religious Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>It is to be ſeen in Ancient Manuſcript Miſſals, that in that which they call the Canon of the Maſs, mention was made of the Alms which the Prieſts received: For whereas the Prieſt ſays
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54276:31"/>only theſe words, <hi>Remember Lord thy Servants and Hand-maids, and all who are preſent;</hi> He heretofore ſaid, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, Lord thy Servants and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids, who make me ſubſiſt by their Alms.</hi>

Memento do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, famulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum famula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque tuarum quorum eleemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynis ſuſtentor. Can. Miſſal. <hi>MS.</hi>
               </note> With many other words which are not at preſent, in the Canon of the Maſs. As it hath always been the belief of the Church, that Prayers, and eſpecially thoſe of the Sacrifice, were very advantageous to the dead; ſo the Monks quickly found the benefit of having Prieſts among them, thereby to attract the Charity of the People, which turned to very good account to them. To them may likewiſe be At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the Original of Private Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, and the multiplication of Altars, for celebrating ſeveral Maſſes, at one and the ſame time: For, according to Ancient Cuſtom, it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſay more than one Maſs, at which all aſſiſted, and it was even a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, that many ſhould celebrate Maſs the ſame day, upon the ſame Altar: Which Cuſtom is ſtill obſerved in the Eaſtern Church.</p>
            <p>In the Formularies of <hi>Marculphus,</hi> many Deeds of Ceſſions or Donations,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54276:31"/>in favour of Monaſteries are to be found. The moſt Common form was expreſſed in theſe Terms: JN. <hi>the Son of</hi> N. <hi>give to ſuch a Monaſtery</hi>
               <note n="(1)" place="margin">Pro reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio animae meae.</note> 
               <hi>for the remedy of my Soul, ſuch &amp; ſuch goods.</hi> Children made the like Donations to Churches, and eſpecially to Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, for the repoſe of the Soul of their Father or Mother.<note place="margin">The form of Ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</note> It was enough for moſt part, to put theſe Terms in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral into the deed,<note n="(2)" place="margin">Pro merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de animae meae, vel genitoris &amp; genitricis meae.</note> 
               <hi>For the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of my Soul, or of the Soul of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother,</hi> without particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Number of Maſſes, as it is practiſed at preſent. And by that means they might receive all the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that preſented, without being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to encreaſe the Number of Prieſts. It is true, there are other Forms of Pious Legations, which are larger, and wherein, beſides theſe terms, <hi>pro remedio animae noſtrae,</hi> it is likewiſe added, <hi>ut pius deus &amp; dominus noſter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54276:32"/>&amp;c.</hi> But in theſe Deeds there is only mention made of Prayers in General. There are nevertheleſs pretty Ancient Forms, wherein mention is made of particular obligations, wherewith the Founders or Benefactors charge the Monaſteries: But theſe Deeds are very rare, and even ſometimes ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſititious. The Emperour <hi>Lovis</hi> II. Son of <hi>Lotharius,</hi> in a Priviledge which he granted to the Abbey of <hi>Caſaur,</hi> ſeated in the <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> of which he was the Founder, obliges the Monks to ſay daily three Maſſes for him, to ſing the Hundred and twentieth <hi>Pſalm</hi> in all the Offices and Hymns of Veſpers and Matins; <hi>and that for the ranſom or remedy of his Soul.</hi> This priviledge is Printed at the end of the ſixth Tome of the Book Entituled, <hi>Italia Sacra;</hi> and though the Author hath taken it out of ſome <hi>Cartularies,</hi> yet there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſeveral Additions and Marks of Forgery, which I found by comparing it with an Ancient <hi>Cartularie</hi> of that Monaſtery, where the ſame Priviledge is written without all theſe Additions. It is true the Number of the Maſſes, and the other Obligations that are in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54276:32"/>Print, are likewiſe in the Manuſcript, but ſeeing in that <hi>Cartulary,</hi> there are many other Priviledges of the ſame Emperour, in favour of the Monaſtery for the ſame thing, where theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are not to be found, there is ground to doubt of the truth of that Priviledge; beſides that in the firſt Deed of the Foundation, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it mentioned. However it be, it is certain that thoſe kinds of Grants contained nothing commonly, but Obligations for Prayers, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for Maſſes, and that but in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: Which hath much contributed to the augmenting of the Revenues of Monaſteries, becauſe the Monks could ſtill receive new Foundations &amp; Pious Legacies, without obliging themſelves for all that to any new Obligations; and private Perſons who were perſwaded, that the Prayers of the Monks would be available to them, made no difficulty of giving their goods to Monaſteries.<note place="margin">Means of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates among the Monks.</note>
            </p>
            <p>By this means the Monks have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired great Eſtates in Lands, which becauſe they would not labour them themſelves, they let out by a kind of Leaſes or Copy-holds, which they

            <p>Thoſe who embraced a Monaſtick Life,<note place="margin">Other means of Acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> contributed much alſo to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of Monaſteries: For it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happened that they who made choice of that Profeſſion, thought it not enough to give themſelves to God, unleſs likewiſe they offered all they had; of which they made a Conveyance, according to the forms uſed in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Countries. The Tenour of that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54276:34"/>Deed, is to be found in the Ancient <hi>Cartulare</hi> of <hi>Caſaure</hi> in theſe terms: <hi>I.</hi> N. <hi>Son of</hi> N. <hi>in ſuch a year of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> N. <hi>and of the Count</hi> N. <hi>offer and give, of my own free will and motion, this preſent day, my proper Perſon, and all the goods which I poſſeſs in ſuch and ſuch places, to ſuch a Monaſtery, where I intend to live the reſt of my days.</hi> And for the greater ſolemnity of this offering, it was made in the Church, where the Perſon laying his hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar, was, with all his Eſtate, offered to God. It is alſo to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the profeſſion of a Monaſtick Life, hindred not the Monks from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting the goods of their Relations, which they might diſpoſe of in favour of their Monaſtery. Beſides, Widows, who having taken the Veil from the Hand of the Biſhop, could not Marry again, gave part of their Eſtates to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery or other Churches, of which a Deed paſt in the following Tenour: <hi>I.</hi> N. <hi>Daughter of</hi> N. <hi>the Servant of God, who have taken the Veil of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, give to</hi> N. <hi>Abbot, or to ſuch a Monaſtery, ſuch and ſuch goods for the remedy of my Soul, and of the Soul of my Husband.</hi>

            <p>The Priviledges granted by Princes to Monaſteries, hath alſo much contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the preſervation, and encreaſe of their Revenues.

The Original of Inveſtitures, which have cauſed ſo much trouble in the Church betwixt Princes &amp; the Pope, proceeds from ſuch Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; in the beginning they ſignified no more, than the Letters whereby the Prince reveſted or inveſted a Church, to ſpeak in the Language of thoſe times.

Before the Inſtitution of St. <hi>Benet,</hi> the Monks were in all things Subject to the Biſhops, and could do nothing without their conſent. But the clauſe of that Inſtitution concerning the Election of Abbots, which is to be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54276:40"/>made by the Monks of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſerved them for a Pretext, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to exempt themſelves from the Juriſdiction of Biſhops.<note place="margin">Original of the Exempri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries.</note> It is true that Monks who depended on Biſhops, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the obſervation of their Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could not chuſe a new Abbot, before they had obtained the permiſſion of their Biſhops. But as they repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Rule, they were not hindered to follow it; and ſo they obtained from the Biſhops power to chuſe their Abbots according to the tenour of their Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. There was no need afterward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to have recourſe to Biſhops for a new Election, for they themſelves left to the Abbot and Monks all that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Rule, and they began to make a difference betwixt the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Biſhops, and the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick diſcipline. The Monks went even a little farther, and obtained from their Biſhops exemptions from epiſcopal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction. And ſo ſoon as the Popes had in the Diocefes of other Biſhops, got the power which they have at preſent, the Authority of Biſhops was greatly diminiſhed. For the Popes granted to Monks, moſt commonly for Money,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54276:40"/>as many exemptions as they pleaſed. We muſt, however, take notice, that the Primitive Exemptions of Monks are not ſo large, as thoſe of later times, and that the more the Authority of Popes has been advanced, the Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Monks have encreaſed propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably. After all, theſe Exemptions have been very advantageous to Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and very uneaſy to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that depended on them. For, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Abbots had all power in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals as well as in Temporals, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates which they had with Church-men were always decided in favour of the Monaſtery.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Abbots moſt commonly compounded with thoſe to whom they gave the adminiſtration of Churches, and cut off part of their Stipend for the uſe of the Monaſtery. And for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceeding in this, they pretended that their Monaſtery had the right of a Baptiſmal Church, and by conſequent the Tithes and other Church Dues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to it. If the Prieſts objected that they had always received the Tithes, and that therefore their Church ought to be accounted Baptiſmal; then

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> confirmed the ſame Decree in one of his Epiſtles, to <hi>Yves</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chartres,</hi> and <hi>Ranul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Xantes,</hi> wherein he ſpeaks to them in theſe terms: <hi>Ipſi Arvernenſi concilio adfuiſtis, in quo praeſidente Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſore

            </p>
            <p>In this manner did Monaſteries and Chapters, who were alſo comprehended in the Decree of the Council of <hi>Clair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> retain to perpetuity ſeveral Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars which did not all belong to them; and they were at the ſame time exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from paying to the Biſhops the uſual dues, that were paid after the death of the Vicars; for obtaining liberty to put other Vicars in their places. It had been, me thinks, more convenient and agreeable to the Ancient Canons, to have left the power of providing for Altars to the Biſhops. And to prove that that right belonged to them, when Laicks were forced to reſtore to the Church the Tithes and other Church Revenues which they poſſeſſed, it was decreed in the Council of <hi>Melfi</hi> under Pope <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rlan</hi> II. <hi>That no Laick ſhould have Liberty to give to Monaſteries or Chapters, Tithes Churches, or other
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54276:43"/>Eccleſiaſtical Rights, without the conſent of the Biſhop of the place, or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Pope.</hi> But it happened that the Biſhops abuſed their Power, and permitted Chapters and Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to receive theſe Rights from Laicks, on Condition of a certain ſum of money to be paid to the Biſhops, for granting Liberty of eſtabliſhing Prieſts or Vicars who might take upon them the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual care of Churches. Theſe decrees of the Popes that were backed with Excommunications, frightned many Laicks, who inſtead of reſtoring the Church Revenues to private Churches, to which they belonged, reſtored them to Chapters and Monaſteries, with the permiſſion of the Biſhops. The Lay-men liked it much better to reſtore the Tithes, and other Eccleſiaſtical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, to Chapters and Monaſteries, from whom they got money, than to private Churches, which had none to give. And therefore Councils decreed that theſe Reſtitutions ſhould not be made without conſent of the Biſhops, thereby to prevent all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts or agreements betwixt Laicks and Eccleſiaſtical Communities.

               </gap> Theſe kinds of Priviledges which were caſily obtained from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> brought in great Revenues to Chapters and Monaſteries, who put Secular Prieſts into the Government of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54276:44"/>Churches, allowing them ſuch moderate Stipends, that the Popes were obliged to condemn that Avarice of the Canons and Monks, who denied Prieſts even a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſubſiſtence.</p>
            <p>The vaſt Rents that Monaſteries en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed gave umbrage to the Biſhops, Canons, and to Princes themſelves, to whom it was repreſented, that moſt part of theſe Revenues ought rather to belong to ſecular Prieſts who ſerved the cures, than to Monks, who by their Profeſſion were excluded from all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Functions But ſeeing the Monks had taken advantage of the ignorance of Secular Prieſts, and that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of moſt Churches was committed to them, it was a difficult task to turn them out, and to re-eſtabliſh Secular Prieſts in Churches. And therefore there happened great conteſts betwixt the Canons and Monks, eſpecially in <hi>England,</hi> where the Monks had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived the Canons of their Canonſhips, and even obliged Secular Prieſts to turn Monks, if they intended to enjoy their Benefices. The Biſhops did what lay in their power to remove the Monks from Church Dignities. But on the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54276:45"/>other hand the Monks had their recourſe to the Popes, who were already become Maſters of a great part of the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Biſhops; and Princes who were perſwaded that Monaſteries were grown too Rich, favoured the Biſhops againſt the Monks and Popes. All the Arch-Biſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had been Monks, from the time of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> whom Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> ſent into <hi>England,</hi> until the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> 1. But when under that Prince, they came to the Election of an Arch Biſhop,<note n="(1)" place="margin">Hiſt. <hi>Sim. Daniel.</hi> 1123.</note> all the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> declared publickly, that they would have no Monk for their Primate, and that amongſt the Clergy there were as virtuous men, and as fit for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Church, as any in the Monaſteries: So by degrees they began to take the Government of Churches out of the hands of Monks, though they were protected by the Popes. Yet they ſtill made a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt Regular Canons and Monks, which continues to this day; for we find but a few Monks that take the Charge of Pariſh-Churches, and perform other Eccleſiaſtical Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions out of their Monaſteries,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54276:45"/>Whereas regular Canons in all places diſcharge thoſe Offices, without being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, as Monks are, to put Secular Prieſts into their Cures.</p>
            <p>There remain at preſent but few Cathedral Churches in the hands of Monks, though heretofore it was a very common thing to ſee no other Canons,<note place="margin">Eccleſiaſtical Employ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Monks.</note> in Churches, but Monks, who at the ſame time took care both of Churches and Monaſteries; which was altogether op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit to the Canons, &amp; even to the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Monaſtick life.<note n="(1)" place="margin">Quiſquis autem ex Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterio ad Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticum or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem pervene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ulterius il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic nec aliquam poteſtatem, nec licentiam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat manendi.</note> St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> indeed, allows Monks to enter into holy Orders, and to officiate in that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, when it ſhall pleaſe their Biſhop to enjoyn them: But then they could no longer continue in their Monaſteries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing become real Clerks. Nevertheleſs the Monks did the contrary,<note place="margin">Greg. Papa.</note> and remaining ſtill in their Monaſteries, took upon them the care of Churches. We even find in the Hiſtory of <hi>England,</hi> that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Archdeacon of a Cathedral Church was annexed to the place of Prior of a Monaſtery. The deſire they had of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching their Houſes, was the true cauſe why they continued in their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties though by right they were ſeparated
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54276:46"/>from them, becauſe of the Eccleſiaſtical Employments in which they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged; and ſo far from laying aſide their Monkiſh cuſtoms, when they were aſſociated to the Clergy, they introduced into their Churches the Practices and Ceremonies of their Monaſteries; and that was the thing that made way for the Re-eſtabliſhment of Secular Prieſts, in Cathedral Churches and other Benefices. But nevertheleſs, part of the Revenues that belonged to Private Churches remained ſtill in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Monaſteries.</p>
            <p>Beſides, Princes and Biſhops could not endure that Monks ſhould poſſeſs Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſiaſtical Dignities, after that the Popes were grown ſo powerful that they diſpoſed at their pleaſure of the moſt part of Benefices. For the Monks always eſpouſed the Intereſts of the Popes againſt Princes and Biſhops, under pretext of defending the liberty of the Church; and ſeeing Princes refuſed to ſubmit to the Pope, with whom they had continual quarrels, they reſolved to give no Eccleſiaſtical Promotions, but to thoſe who were devoted to their Service.

And in this manner did Princes with aſſiſtance of the Biſhops endeavour to re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Secular Prieſts in the Churches according to Preſcripts of the Canon Law. But that was not done without great difficulty, becauſe the Monks were protected by the Popes, whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was become formidable; and it is to that time eſpecially, that we ought to attribute a great part of the Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the Monks obtained from <hi>Rome,</hi> that they might not depend on the Biſhops who endeavoured their Ruine.</p>

Though that may indeed, be true of ſome, yet it cannot be generally affirmed of all; for the Records of thoſe Churches evince the contrary. Nevertheleſs the titles which they produce ought to be well examined, becauſe many of them are falſe. Seeing Biſhops and Abbots were at that time employed in the greateſt affairs of State, it was eaſy for them to obtain what they deſired of Princes: Beſides that, they being more capable of buſineſs than Laicks, the ſame Princes conſided much in them.

In a word, Kings and the Biſhops of places handled in Councils, the affairs which the Popes now a days pretend to belong to them by Divine Right. It is true, under the Second Race of the <hi>French Kings,</hi> the Authority of the Popes was greater in <hi>France;</hi> But it was ſtill limited by the Princes, without whoſe conſent they could do nothing, even in the cauſes, which are called the greater, and whereof the deciſion ſeemed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the Popes. As to matters of ſmaller importance, the Biſhops had the abſolute power over them, and the whole diſpoſition of Benefices depended on them. The Popes had never dreamt of the right which is now eſtabliſhed, if private men who diſputed one with another about the validity of their Elections, had not had their recourſe to the chief See for deciſion of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies.

               <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> ordained the Biſhops that were within the extent of their Patriarchſhip, and that the Pope did the ſame in regard of the Biſhops

            <p>And this is the ground upon which the Canoniſts pretend that the Pope hath the diſpoſal of all the Churches in the World. They are nevertheleſs obliged to confeſs that that Right was unknown to the Ancients, and that it is no where contained but in the Book of the Decretals. Nay I dare be bold to affirm that the Decretals contain but part of that new right whereof the Pope is at preſent in Poſſeſſion, and that ſince the Collection of the Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> hath made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcoveries in Beneficiary matters, of which I ſhall not ſpeak in this place. It ſhall be enough for me to obſerve here, that nothing is eſteemed at <hi>Rome,</hi> but the preſent Maxims; that the Decrees of <hi>Gratian</hi> are not valued there, becauſe they contain for moſt part nothing but

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it is in his power to change the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and to introduce New ones, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the neceſſity of times, places and occaſions. If it happen that Princes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Execution of their Bulls, they eaſily take up the matter by <hi>Concordats</hi> or other means, without any prejudic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> at all to their pretenſions; becauſe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Popes are always on that lock with Princes, and what they cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at one time, they hope to obtain on

That hath been a very advantageous Maxim to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath obtained at one time, what was impoſſible to be obtained at another. They indeed propoſe matters according to the rigour, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions; but they ſuffer Princes to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate them according to the Cuſtoms received in their Kingdoms.<note place="margin">The Cuſtom of <hi>France</hi> in the reception of Bulls.</note> And that is the reaſon why ſeveral of the Popes Bulls are not received in <hi>France,</hi> and that they are not regiſtred, till firſt they be examined, to ſee whether they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any thing contrary to the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church.

               </note> which they enjoy at preſent. Theſe Rights differ according to the diverſity of Countreys; but I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treat in this place of the Rights of the <hi>Regale,</hi> of which the Kings of <hi>France</hi> are in Poſſeſſion.

But in what manner ſoever that was performed, whether by Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or Archdeacons, it is ſtill true that Princes took no ſhare in the Fruits of vacant Biſhopricks, ſince one part of them were employed for the occaſions of the Church, and the other preſerved for the ſucceeding Biſhop.

            <p>We muſt not,<note place="margin">The <hi>Regale</hi> different from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture.</note> neither, confound the Right of Inveſtiture, with the Right of the <hi>Regale,</hi> as ſome Authors have
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54276:55"/>done. For it is not to be found in Hiſtory, nor in any Ancient Deed, that Emperours and Kings, who have had the Inveſtitures of Biſhopricks and Abbeys, have therefore enjoyed the Revenues of Churches, during the Vacancy of the See: but application was only made to them for proceeding to a new Election, which was not to be made without their conſent; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they gave to Biſhopricks and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, the Inveſtiture of Lands or Fiefs which had been left to them; in the manner as we have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
            <p>Before the Popes diſputed the Right of Inveſtiture with Princes,<note place="margin">An Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Inveſtiture.</note> and claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Power over Elections, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture contained nothing of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, but only Temporal Rights, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Lands &amp; Fees in which Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks and Monaſteries were inveſted, and the Biſhops had full liberty to give the Conſecration wherein the Spiritual conſiſted. If Popes had not had a deſign to take from Princes the Right which they had in Elections, they had never thought of reckoning the Inveſtiture among Spiritual things. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54276:56"/>worſe grounded, than that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Inveſtiture which is mentioned in the Agreement that was made betwixt Pope <hi>Calixtus</hi> II. and the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> IV. The Pope grants to <hi>Henry,</hi> that all Elections of Biſhops and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, ſhall be made in his preſence, thereby to prevent diſorder; and that thoſe who ſhould be elected, ſhould receive from the Emperour, the <hi>Regales</hi> or <hi>Regalities</hi> by the Scepter. <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperour at the ſame time obliges himſelf, not to give Inveſtitures by the Ring and Staff or Baton, and allows the Liberty of Elections. But that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Inveſtitures given by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral Staff, and by the Scepter, as if the firſt had been a thing Spiritual, and the other meerly Temporal, has no ground in the World. Inveſtitures were barely given by the Staff and Ring whether that Staff was called, Royal or Paſtoral. <hi>Simony</hi> conſiſted not in the form of Inveſtiture, but in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours taking of Money, from thoſe to whom they gave it; and ſince that was always done before the Election, it might be ſaid that the Election was Simoniacal. That abuſe ought to have
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54276:56"/>been corrected, and matters left as they were before.</p>

               </note>M. <hi>de Marca,</hi> who relates the Decree of that Council, obſerves that the term <hi>Regalia</hi> is there taken in a new ſenſe, for the keeping and enjoying of all the Fruits and Revenues during the Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the See: And beſides, he adds, that under the name of Fruits, the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Benefices are comprehended, becauſe of the Conſtitution of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:54276:61"/>III. which preceded that Council, wherein it is expreſt, that the Collation of Benefices ought to be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Fruits and Profits. But it ſeems to me that the Intention of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> X. in that Council, was to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the future, Lay-men of what Quality ſoever they were, from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading Church-Lands and Revenues, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Vacancy of the See, under any pretext that might be alledged, either of the <hi>Regale,</hi> Cuſtody or Protection; becauſe, in effect, they who ſeized the Revenues of Churches after the Death of the Biſhops, never wanted Reaſons for it, alledging the pretext of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection or Cuſtody. The Council com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the Right of the <hi>Regale,</hi> which ſeveral Princes enjoyed, with the other Rights which many great men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for poſſeſſing the Revenues of Churches during the Vacancy of the See. But ſince the Maxims of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law are for moſt part taken from the Civil, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> thought it fit<note n="(1)" place="margin">Tantum praſcriptum, quantum poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſum.</note> to leave thoſe Rights to thoſe who were already in poſſeſſion of them, without examining the lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs of the Titles; becauſe it
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54276:61"/>would have been a difficult matter to have ſucceeded in it, by reaſon of the long Poſſeſſion of many Princes, which gives a ſufficient Title in the Civil Law.</p>
            <p>As to the Collation of Benefices, I do not think that the Council intended to comprehend them under the name of Fruits and Revenues, as M. <hi>de Marca</hi> affirms. The truth is, it is a Maxim received and authorized by Cuſtom ſince the Introduction of the New Law, that Collations are of the number of Fruits:<note n="(1)" place="margin">Collatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſunt in fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctibus.</note>But the term Collation is then taken in a larger ſenſe, to wit, for the Preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Nomination to Benefices; whereas the Kings of <hi>France</hi> by the Right of the <hi>Regale,</hi> enjoy a real Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Benefices,<note place="margin">The Right of Collation at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Kings of <hi>France</hi> by the <hi>Regale.</hi>
               </note> which the Canoniſts affirm to have ſomething of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.

Nay, the <hi>Regale</hi> gives more Right to the King of <hi>France</hi> in regard of the Spiritual, than Biſhops have: For it is a Maxim of Canoniſts, that none but the Pope can receive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignations <hi>in favorem;</hi> and the reaſon
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54276:62"/>they give is, becauſe a Reſignation made in favour of another, is a kind of Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and that the Pope alone, who is above Eccleſiaſtical Laws, can diſpenſe with it: <hi>Solus Papa,</hi> ſay they, <hi>purgat à Simonia:</hi> But they ſhould add, <hi>&amp; Rex Francorum;</hi> for the King of <hi>France</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Reſignations which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>in favorem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are a great many other Rights which the Kings of <hi>France</hi> enjoy by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the <hi>Regale,</hi> and which are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to that Right. The Lawyers and <hi>French</hi> Canoniſts have much ado to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Original of theſe Rights, which they ſuppoſe according to the common Rules of the Canon Law to be Spiritual Rights, and by conſequent not to belong to Lay-perſons, unleſs it be by a ſpecial Priviledge granted by Popes to the Kings of <hi>France:</hi> But ſince no ſuch Priviledge can be made appear, and that on the other hand, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> pretend not to hold that Right by Priviledge of the Pope, the difficulty grows greater.<note place="margin">Boniſ.

               <hi>Johan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Pariſienſis,</hi> who wrote at that time upon the ſame Subject, affirms that there is a difference to be made betwixt Princes and Subjects, in that theſe as being inferiour to others in Knowledge, and diſcerning of Perſons proper for Benefices, could not but preſent; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Princes might confer,<note n="(1)" place="margin">Habent om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem peritiam inſcrinio pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoris.</note> as being endowed with a full and entire Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But that Reaſon does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in the point in hand, where the Queſtion is of the Spiritual, and not of the Temporal.</p>
            <p>That difficulty nevertheleſs may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be reſolved, if we ſuppoſe that the Right of Collation which belongs to Biſhops, is not properly a Spiritual Right; and that therefore Laicks who have enjoyed it by a long Cuſtom, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be excluded from it. It is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved then, that according to the Rules of the Ancient Canon-Law, the Collation of a Beneſice was wholly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, becauſe then there was no other Collation, but only the Ordination, which cannot be given but by the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54276:63"/>Biſhop. But ſince Ordination hath been diſtinguiſhed from the Eccleſiaſtical Function, many new terms have been invented; and among others, that of Collation or Inſtitution, and the Right of Collating is attributed only to the Biſhops; ſo that Lay-Patrons may name or preſent to Benefices, provided thoſe whom they have preſented, take Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or Inſtitution from the Biſhops, which alone gives the power of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spiritual Functions. Nevertheleſs, we find in <hi>France,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> many Laicks, who in full Right confer Benefices, as well as the King There are even Abbeſſes, as the Abbeſs of <hi>Montivillers,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Caux,</hi> who in full Right confer Cures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any neceſſity of having recourſe to the Ordinary for Collation or Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I know it will be anſwered to this, that Laicks, who enjoy that Right, are grounded on Priviledges granted them by the Pope. But however it be, it is certain, that if that Right were neceſſarily inherent in the Quality of Biſhop, the Pope could not by a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge grant it to Laicks, no more than he can grant the Right of Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54276:63"/>wherein the Spiritual really conſiſts. And therefore that Collation which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds Ordination, is not the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality with the Ordination; but it hath been only thought neceſſary to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Perſons uncapable from poſſeſſing Benefices. The Right of conferring Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices deprives not Biſhops of the Right they have of Judging of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of thoſe who have received Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution or Collation from Laicks: For beſides that firſt Inſtitution, which is called <hi>Collative Inſtitution,</hi> there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Inſtitution called <hi>Inſtitutio Autoriſabilis,</hi> which gives the Biſhops power to examine the Capacity of thoſe, on whom Laicks have conferred Benefices, that ſo they may authorize their Collation. There is no ſuch great difficulty then, as is commonly imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to conceive the Right of conferring Benefices, which the Kings of <hi>France</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy by virtue of the <hi>Regale.</hi> That which is called Spirituality in beneficial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſince the Introduction of the new Canon-Law, is far different from that which is truly Spiritual according to the Ancient Canons; and that's a thing not ſufficiently minded by the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts.

               </note> Nay and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Second Race, <hi>Charlemain</hi> who gave a great deal of authority to Popes, did not conſult them about the Erection of the new Biſhopricks and Arch-Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks which he eſtabliſhed. In <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf, many Ages after, the Princes and Biſhops were abſolute Maſters of all that belonged to Churches. The Prince or Judges appointed by him, decided the differences that happened betwixt Biſhops and Abbots, and amongſt other Church-Men, concerning their Revenues and Priviledges: but ſeeing matters
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54276:69"/>now a days are ſettled in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that the Diſcipline of the Church is wholly altered, I thought it neceſſary, having obſerved the original and Progreſs of Church Revenues, to deſcribe in a few words the preſent State of beneficial matters. It would be to no purpoſe to know the Cuſtoms of our Fore-Fathers, if we be ignorant of what is at preſent in uſe amongſt our ſelves. The former ſerve only for our inſtruction, but the latter will be uſeful for the conduct of our lives.<note place="margin">An Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the New Canon Law.</note> I ſhall ſay nothing in this place of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Benefices, in the manner that they are eſtabliſhed at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; for it is very well known that they did nor begin till about the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Century: And whereas in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Canons there is only mention made of Ordination and the Miniſtry, afterward there was no more talk but of the Portion or Benefice. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, though the manners of expreſſion, and a great part of the Ancient Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline were wholly changed, yet in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things the Maxims of the Ancient Law were ſtill obſerved. For Inſtance, heretofore Ordination differed not from
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54276:70"/>the Miniſtry or Benefice; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when by the Introduction of the New Law, they were ſeparated, that Maxim was ſtill retained, That he who can Ordain, can alſo Confer a Benefice; and that he who cannot Ordain, cannot Confer a Benefice neither. But by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the Popes have by their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Exemptions derogated from the Common Law that was grounded on the Ancient Canons; and we ſee that Abbots exempted from the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Ordinaries, confer in full right, Cures and other Benefices. Though the Eſtabliſhment of Benefices be commonly referred to the end of the Tenth Century, or beginning of the Eleventh, yet ſome footſteps of them are to be ſeen long before. For about the year 500 under Pope <hi>Symmachus,</hi> to ſome Church-men Portions of Land were aſſigned, to be enjoyed by them for Life, as appears by the terms of<note n="(1)" place="margin">Tom. <hi>1.</hi> Concil. Gal. Ann. <hi>513.</hi>
               </note> the Epiſtle of that Pope to <hi>Caeſarius,</hi> where he prohibits the alienation of Church-Lands, unleſs it be in favours of Clerks who might have merited, or of ſome Monaſteries or Hoſpitals, and that only during the Life of thoſe that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54276:70"/>ſhould enjoy them. <hi>Poſſeſſiones,</hi>

            <p>There are beſides ſome footſteps of the Foundations of Benefices, and of the Right of Patronage in the Tenth Canon of<note n="(1)" place="margin">

The Fathers and Councils were not ſtudied in their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, but only in the Decrees of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian;</hi> and Men were not knowing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough at that time, to perceive that a great many of the Citations of <hi>Gratian</hi> were falſe, and that he followed not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the Rules of the Ancient Laws, having inſerted into his Collection ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſuppoſititious Pieces. Beſides that, he gave to the Popes Decretals the ſame Authority as to general Councils, and ſometimes even perverted the words of the Ancient Canons, that he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate them to the Law which was authorized by the Popes of his Time. But the Collection of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal Epiſtles of Popes, which<note n="(1)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ann.</hi> 1230.</note> was made by order of <hi>Gregory</hi> IX. occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a far greater Alteration in the Affairs of the Church: Nevertheleſs, they were in <hi>France</hi> publickly read in Schools, as well as the Collection of <hi>Gratian.</hi> Theſe Decretals have been the cauſe of an infinite number of Law-Suits; and though they were received in the Weſtern Church, and publickly taught by the Profeſſors of the Canon Law, yet there was a neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54276:72"/>them on ſeveral occaſions, and having recourſe to the Ancient Canons. At that time the Compilation of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> was called the Ancient Law, though it contained a great many Novelties: But being compared with the Book of Decretals, there was ſome reaſon for calling it ſo. The tedious and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Debates which the Kings of <hi>France</hi> had with the Popes, was the cauſe that the <hi>French</hi> deſpiſed the Collection of the Decretals; nor are they at preſent much eſteemed by them. They are of Opinion that that work was only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled, for eſtabliſhing the Intereſts of the Pope, and overturning the Ancient Law. And the Satyrs that were made againſt the Decretals run ſtill in their minds, eſpecially this Proverb which was heretofore ſo common.</p>

            <p>But after all, as to what concerns the common practice, the Decretals are to be preferred before the Decrees, ſeeing moſt of the Rules of Law which now are in uſe, are taken out of the Book of Decretals, and not from the Collection of <hi>Gratian.</hi> Nor is the ſixth Book of Decretals to be ſlighted, which is commonly called the Sext, though it was compiled<note n="(1)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ann.</hi> 1298.</note> by the order of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. an enemy of the <hi>French;</hi> becauſe a great part of the Conſtitutions that are contained in that Collection have been taken out of the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and are obſerved in <hi>France,</hi> Beſides, the Decretals which carry the Title of <hi>Clementine,</hi> becauſe that Collection is attributed to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> V. have been for moſt part taken out of the Council of <hi>Vienne,</hi> where the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France</hi> were preſent. The other Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals that are contained in the Body of the Canon Law under the name of the <hi>Extravagants</hi> of <hi>John</hi> XXII. and the common <hi>Extravigants,</hi> ſeem not to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54276:73"/>have ſo great authority in <hi>France,</hi> as the former Decretals; Neither do I think that all the new Bulls of which the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary is compoſed, are much eſteemed there, becauſe they have never been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since the great claſhings that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened betwixt <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. And <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the Fair, and betwixt <hi>Julius</hi> II. and <hi>Louis</hi> XII. The <hi>French</hi> have been much more cautious in admitting the Bulls of the Pope, than they were before. The differences likewiſe that happened in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>France,</hi> have been alſo the cauſe that the <hi>French</hi> ſuſpect all that comes from <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they ſubmit not eaſily to its Laws. And therefore the Popes Bulla are not received till firſt they be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and, if it be neceſſary, modified; Nay and many times they are not actually received. In a word, there are but ſome of the Rules of the Chancery received in <hi>France.</hi> Theſe are now the grounds on which the new Law is founded, and which hath been very much qualified in <hi>France,</hi> the knowledge whereof is neceſſary, that we may underſtand what meaſures are
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54276:73"/>at preſent to be taken in Beneficial matters.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>France</hi> hath ſubmitted to the New Law,<note place="margin">The Original of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> yet hath it ſtill retain'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Ancient Canons: And when it hath found the new Laws to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Intereſt of the State, it hath had recourſe to the Ancient, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it ſelf by the Canon Law. And therefore they have given the name of Priviledges or Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, to that which was no more but the Ancient Canon Law; But which hath been called Priviledges or Liberties in reſpect of the New. For inſtance, when the <hi>French</hi> have been preſſed by the Authority of the Decretals, they have had recourſe to the Ancient Law contained in the Decrees of <hi>Gratian;</hi> but ſince the Collection of <hi>Gratian au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſes</hi> a great many falſe Decretals of the firſt Popes, which have introduced a New Law, the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops have had recourſe to a more Ancient Compilation of <hi>Canons,</hi> when the Authority of theſe Decretals hath been objected to them. Nevertheleſs, for all that <hi>France</hi> could do, the Popes Law hath at length prevailed, notwithſtanding the Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54276:74"/>of the Kings, who endeavoured the re-eſtabliſhment of the Ancient Canons.</p>
            <p>The moſt Ancient Pragmatick of <hi>France</hi> is attributed<note n="(1)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ann.</hi> 1268.</note> to St. <hi>Louis:</hi> But there is ground to doubt whether it be his or not, though it ſeems no man hath hitherto queſtioned it. The reaſon why it is thought to be of St. <hi>Louis,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it bears the name of a King called <hi>Louis,</hi> and that the Date proves evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that it can be of no other <hi>Louis,</hi> but <hi>Louis</hi> IX. <hi>Elias</hi> of <hi>Bourdeille</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Tours,</hi> who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made a Cardinal, hath mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Articles of that Pragmatick in a Writing that he compoſed in the the time of <hi>Louis</hi> XI. againſt the Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Sanction of <hi>France.</hi> It is true, he refutes the Pragmatick of St. <hi>Louis,</hi> as if it had been really the Act of that Prince: But he ſeems to have doubted of it, not daring abſolutely to affirm that he was the Author of it, but only<note n="(2)" place="margin">Adſcribi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ei feciſſe pragmaticam.</note> that it was aſcribed to him. The Contemporary Authors who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his Life, ſpeak not a word of it. The Popes who have ſo vigorouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed whatever they thought contrary
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54276:74"/>to their Intereſts, did not at that time complain of that Pragmatick, though it wholly ruined their Intereſts. Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that in the<note n="(1)" place="margin">

Nothing could at that time have been of greater force to authorize that Aſlembly. There appears nothing more Ancient in favours of the Pragmatick of St. <hi>Louis,</hi> than the Remonſtrances made by the Members of Parliament to King <hi>Louis</hi> XI. And there is a great deal of probability that it hath been foiſted in about that time<note n="(2)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ann.</hi> 1461.</note> becauſe it was known that King <hi>Louis,</hi> being then but Dauphin, was of Intelligence with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> for abrogating the Pragmatick made at <hi>Bourges;</hi> and the Members of Parliament omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that could make for that Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. There are beſides, terms ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what extraordinary in the Pragmatick attributed to St. <hi>Louis.</hi> Theſe words, <hi>ad perpetuam rei memoriam,</hi> are not of the ſtile of Ordinances. Nor do we find any where elſe, that St <hi>Louis</hi> affected
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54276:75"/>that way of ſpeaking that his Crown depended of God alone; neither was it at all proper for the affairs that then were in agitation. I could bring a great many other Reaſons, to ſhew that there is ground to doubt of the Reality of that Pragmatick: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that that would lead me into a long and tedious digreſſion, the Canon Law of <hi>France</hi> ſubſiſts not ſo much upon the Pragmatick aſcribed to St. <hi>Louis,</hi> as upon that of <hi>Bourges,</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordat which hath derogated from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Articles thereof.</p>
            <p>To know then the ſubſtance of the Law of <hi>France</hi> in regard of Beneficial matters.<note place="margin">The Rules of the <hi>French</hi> Law.</note> We muſt not wholly rely on the Popes Decretals; but it is alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to know wherein the Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, Concordat, the Edicts of the Kings, and the Sentences of Supream Courts differ from the Law eſtabliſhed in the Decretals. Beſides, ſeeing the the Concordat or Treaty that paſt<note n="(1)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ann.</hi> 1516.</note> betwixt <hi>Leo</hi> X. and <hi>Francis</hi> I. hath abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſeveral Articles of the Pragmatick, there is no more of the Pragmatick to be retained, but what hath not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcinded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54276:75"/>does the Concordat it ſelf entirely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt at preſent, becauſe the Popes and Kings of <hi>France</hi> have by mutual conſent derogated from it in many heads. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt we inſiſt too much on Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; for there are ſome of them, eſpecially thoſe that were made in the States aſſembled at <hi>Orleans,</hi> which have not been received into practice. In fine, the Juriſprudence of Decrees hath not always been the ſame, and does ſtill vary daily; and which is obſervable, Courts do not agree among themſelves in their deciſions; not only Courts in different Provinces, where it is hard that Judgments can be the ſame, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the different Cuſtoms on which they are grounded, rather than the Law; but even in <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Maxims of Parliament differ from thoſe of the great Council, and many times the Council of State hath Prejudications which agree not with thoſe that are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the Parliament, and in the great Council. It were to be deſired, that there might be an uniformity in Judgments, which would not be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be put in practice. Theſe are the Principles of the <hi>French,</hi> which I have
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54276:76"/>trac'd with all poſſible Exactneſs. In the ſequel of this Diſcourſe, I ſhall treat of the Cuſtoms of <hi>France</hi> in reſpect of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial matters.</p>

Let us begin with the Right of Popes.</p>
            <p>The Pope may concur with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries,<note place="margin">The Rights of Popes.</note> becauſe he is the Ordinary of Ordinaries, and that his Juriſdiction extends over all the Churches in the World, for which Reaſon he may alſo prevent them. He pretends to a fulneſs
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54276:77"/>of Power, which he hath not renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by communicating the ſame to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; whence it follows, that without overthrowing the right of Ordinaries he may prevent them; and he that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents firſt, has the advantage. I ſpeak here, according to the Maxims of the New Law, without examining whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be true or falſe, becauſe that would be needleſs in regard of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice which is the matter in hand. The Pope may then in full right confer Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices by Prevention; but ſeeing Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention is very prejudicial to the Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Ordinaries, it is qualified in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Prevention hath no place at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but for Vacant Benefices, and the Pope cannot now diſpoſe of Benefices before they be Vacant, as he did hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, reſerving them to his own diſpoſal.

That right of Graduats,<note place="margin">The Right of Graduats.</note> which is founded on the Pragmatick and Concordat, is ſo owned in <hi>France,</hi> that ſome <hi>French</hi> Lawyers, nay even ſome Parliaments pretend that the Prevention of the Pope cannot be prejudicial to Graduats; but the moſt received cuſtom of <hi>France</hi> admits the Popes Prevention in prejudice of the Graduats and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged.</p>

If the Ordinary hath conferred the ſame Benefice before him, though the Collation be null and void, yet it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the effect of Prevention; ſo that in that caſe nothing produces ſomewhat; and it is held for an undoubted Maxim, that <hi>Collatio Ordinarii, etiam nulla &amp; invalida, impedit preventionem Papa.</hi> We muſt, in the mean while, obſerve that the bare Preſentation of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron is not ſufficient to hinder the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54276:79"/>becauſe the Preſentation alone gives not the Benefice; it is neceſſary that<note n="(1)" place="margin">

Nevertheleſs, many are of opinion that the bare Preſentation of the Patron is ſufficient to hinder the Popes Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from taking effect; and they are grounded on this, that the Right of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention is odious, and therefore ought not to be favoured. On the other hand, it is acknowledged by all, that the Popes Prevention hath only place, <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do res ſunt integrae,</hi> when matters are entire. Now, ſay they, it cannot be affirmed that matters continue ſtill in an entire Condition, when the Patron hath given his Preſentation, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a Right to him that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and it is certain that<note n="(2)" place="margin">Juri quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſito Papa non poteſt derogare.</note> the Pope cannot derogate from an acquired Right.

            <pb n="144" facs="tcp:54276:80"/>
            <p n="2">II. The Indulged and <hi>Graduats</hi> hinder the Popes Prevention, when they have made their demand in form; for then <hi>res non cenſentur integrae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. The Pope himſelf hath derogat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his right of Prevention in favours of Cardinals, to whom he hath granted Priviledges or Immunities, that they ſhall not be prevented by him. There are likewiſe ſome Perſons of Quality that obtain the ſame Priviledge from the Pope; and ſo they have the whole ſix Months for providing to their benefices, according to the Rules of the Canon Law, without any danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prevented.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To the end the Popes Prevention may obtain its effect, there muſt be neither fraud nor ſurpriſe in it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rule of the Chancery <hi>de veriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mili notitia,</hi> is received in <hi>France;</hi> and it is neceſſary, that betwixt the death of the Beneficiary and the Collation of the Pope, a ſufficient time muſt intervene for carrying to <hi>Rome</hi> the news of the Vacancy of the Benefice if the contrary be proved the Prevention is Judged frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent and Anticipated, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent null.</p>
            <pb n="145" facs="tcp:54276:80"/>
            <p>Beſides the right of Prevention, the Pope hath alſo the right of Devolution in quality of Superiour; and in that caſe by common Law he may confer all Benefices after a certain time. The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary hath ſix Months to provide for the Benefices that depend on him, and theſe ſix Months are reckoned from the day that he might have had knowledge of the Vacancy. If he provide not within theſe ſix Months, the right is devolved on the immediate Superiour; for inſtance from the Biſhop to the Metropolitan, from the Metropolitan to the Primate, if the Primate enjoy that right, and from the Primate to the Pope, following in that the order of Juriſdiction. But the right of Devolution is of no great uſe to the Pope, becauſe it is ſwallowed up in the right of Prevention; and beſides Benefices muſt continue vacant for the ſpace of a year or two, before that he could confer them by devolution, unleſs it be in reſpect of Collators who depend immediatly upon himſelf. If it happen nevertheleſs, that the ordinary Collator hath provided amiſs, his right devolves inſtantly upon the immediate Superior, and the Ordinary hath no more right
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54276:81"/>of conferring the Benefice for that time. In that kind of devolution, application <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The Pope, on the contrary, can give one and the ſame Benefice to ſeveral Perſons, becauſe his power is not ſmited, as that of Ordinaries, and his right cannot be devolved, as not having any Superior. That right which Popes enjoy is the cauſe of an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Law-ſuits.

And therefore there was reaſon to ſay that the Kings Commiſſioners were ſurpriſed and over reached, when they ſuffered that clauſe of the Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat to paſs: For it is certain, that the Benefices, which are provided by way of Election, were not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the Chapter <hi>Licet,</hi> nor of the Conſtitution <hi>de beneficiis vacantibus in Curia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide it is not doubted but that the nomination of the King
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54276:82"/>hath been ſurrogated in place of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and by conſequent ought to enjoy all their rights. So that the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to which the King Nominates by Virtue of the <hi>Concordat,</hi> ought not to be reſerved to the Pope when they are vacant <hi>in curia.</hi> And this the Officers of the King pretend at preſent in <hi>France,</hi> and the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> hath ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently explained it ſelf on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>It would ſeem nevertheleſs, that the King acknowledges that Reſervation of the Popes, eſpecially when he gives his Grant to thoſe who are not of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and who may chance to die at Court.

            <p>The New Law received in <hi>France</hi> gives the Pope many other Powers which they enjoyed not,<note place="margin">Other Rights of the Popes.</note> when the Church was governed according to the Ancient Canons.</p>

               <item>II. Biſhops cannot be tranſlated from one See to another, without taking New Bulls from the Pope: And if they enjoy Abbeys or other Conſiſtorial Benefices, they are alſo obliged to take new Bulls for all theſe Benefices, and by conſequent to pay new Annats or Firſt-fruits. But it is ſtill to be ſuppoſed that the Pope cannot put this Power in execution without the Kings Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: And even in the Bulls of Tranſlation the conſent of the King is mentioned.</item>
               <item>III. The Pope by his Bulls confirms thoſe whom the King hath named to Biſhopricks, Abbeys and other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorial Benefices.</item>
               <item>IV. The King cannot enjoy his Right of Nomination to Biſhopricks and Abbeys which are not ſituated in the places mentioned in the Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54276:84"/>but the Pope grants him Indults or Priviledges to nominate to thoſe Benefices.

               <item>V. It being a general Maxim re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and approved of all, that Secular Benefices ought to be given to Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and Regular Benefices to Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, the King cannot Emancipate Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices from the Rule, to put them in <hi>Commendum,</hi> unleſs he have Permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Pope, becauſe that is one of the Clauſes of the Concordat: But the King and Pope, who have made the Concordat, diſpenſe with it daily, it being in their Power ſo to do.</item>
               <item>VI. The Pope, who pretends to an abſolute Power over all Benefices, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

               <item>VII. The King cannot Alienate the Church Lands of his Kingdom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the permiſſion and conſent of the Pope;<note place="margin">Alienations depend on the Pope.</note> nor can he raiſe the Tenths of he Clergy, which have in proceſs of time, been converted into Ordinary Subſidies, without obtaining Power from the Pope. Heretofore Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men pretended that their goods were conſecrated to God, and that ſo, they were not obliged to lay them out for maintaining of Wars, or for other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick neceſſities; it being enough that they contributed to them by their
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54276:85"/>Prayers. But the ſpecious pretext of holy Wars cured them of that Scruple, and it was decreed in the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> III. That theſe Tenths ſhould be taken from Eccleſiaſticks, for the Expeditions of the Holy Land. After a Door was once opened to Tenths, the Popes and Kings together often raiſe them. But ſeeing Popes had got a Cuſtom of raiſing Tenths in <hi>France</hi> for their own private concerns, it was decreed in the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantienſe.</note> that they ſhould be no more raiſed, but with conſent of the Prelates of the Kingdom; and thereby the Popes were excluded from the Liberty of raiſing them. However, thoſe that were granted to Kings encreaſed much, and that which in the beginning was very extraordinary, hath ſince turned into a Cuſtom. The neceſſity of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining long Wars in <hi>France</hi> for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, promoted very much the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Tenths, which is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a kind of Tax upon the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, collected by receivers, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that purpoſe. We muſt, in the mean time, obſerve that Popes diſpoſe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54276:85"/>not at their pleaſure of Church Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, as they pretend they have Power. They have not the Liberty to ſell the Revenues of the Church, unleſs the King and Clergy conſent to it, and the cauſes of Alienation be firſt examined: For the Bulls of Permiſſion to alienate are not received in <hi>France,</hi> if they contain theſe Terms, <hi>motu proprio, ſine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitione, etiam invitis Clericis.</hi> In a Word, for Alienation of Church Lands in <hi>France,</hi> the two Soveraign Powers, I mean, the Pope and King muſt concur.</item>
               <item>VIII. All Concordats,<note place="margin">Concordats depending on the Pope.</note> Tranſactions or Pactions in any beneficial matter, ought to be confirmed in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe there is a kind of Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in them, private perſons not being allowed to diſpoſe of their Benefices under certain Reſervations or Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and that is the reaſon why ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is made to the Pope for Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Reſignations <hi>in favorem.</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries cannot appoint, nor confirm Penſions: Nor can they admit of any Reſignations <hi>in favorem</hi> neither, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the caſe of Permutation; Nay
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54276:86"/>and in that caſe too private perſons many times apply themſelves to the Pope. There is another kind of Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat, or Tranſaction, which Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datary Abbots, and Monks, daily make betwixt themſelves, for dividing their Revenues, without having recourſe to <hi>Rome.</hi> But theſe Concordats are eaſily broken, and their Succeſſors may derogate from them, becauſe an Abbot hath no power to oblige and tye up the Will of his Succeſſor. He may, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, make over his rights during his life; but he cannot diſpoſe of that which belongs to another. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though theſe Concordats were even confirmed in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the Parliaments, they may ſtill be reſcinded, if it be found that one of the Parties contracting hath received any notable prejudice: In that caſe he is allowed to ſeek relief, and by ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger reaſon his Succeſſour ought, who is not obliged to ſtand to all that hath been done by his Predeceſſor. The Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf pretends not to prejudice by his Reſcripts the acquired right of others; nor indeed is it in his power, though it ſhould even be inſerted in his Reſcript,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54276:86"/>that there hath nothing been done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge of the cauſe, becauſe he may have been ill informed. Again, the Pope hath no power in <hi>France</hi> over the Temporal of Benefices, but only the Spiritual, for which recourſe is had to him as to a Superiour, that he may authorize the Tranſactions which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons have made amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and purge them from Simony.</item>
               <item>IX. None but the Pope can give Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices in perpetual <hi>Commendum;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Commendums</hi> depend on the Pope.</note> and the <hi>French</hi> are the more obliged to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that power of the Popes, that there is no Kingdom in Chriſtendom where ſo many Regular Benefices are Erected in <hi>Commendum,</hi> as in <hi>France.</hi> Now ſeeing <hi>Commendums,</hi> in the manner that they are at preſent eſtabliſhed, more for the advantage of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, than benefit of the Church, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together contrary to the Canons; none but the Pope can confer in <hi>Commendum,</hi> becauſe he only can diſpenſe with the Canons, as well in reſpect of the inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of perſons to whom <hi>Commendums</hi> are given, as of incompatibility of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, in which the Commendataries are inveſted.

                  <hi>Commendum</hi> are in ſome manner reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Pope, becauſe they ſubſiſt upon a ſpecial Priviledge, which can be granted by none but him: And when the <hi>Commendum</hi> is void by the death of the Commendatary, it is not to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vacant by his death, but as it was vacant before the <hi>Commendum,</hi> which brings no alteration in matters.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54276:88"/>Diſcipline of the Church. I only ſpeak, at preſent, of what is in practice, and of the power that the Popes have in <hi>France,</hi> where the Bulls, whereof I have given ſome abſtracts, are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and authoriſed by cuſtom. And for that reaſon alſo, the Canoniſts ſay, that the Titles of Benefices are only of poſitive right, &amp; that ſo, the Popes who have abſolute power over that right, eſpecially when it hath been voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhed by them, may diſpenſe with it as they pleaſe, and in favours of whom they will. On this principle are grounded the Diſpenſations which are obtained from Popes, for poſſeſſing ſeveral Benefices, and that they daily derogate from the nature and quality of Benefices in favours of private perſons. But after all we muſt ſtill ſuppoſe the Maxime which we have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that this great power of Popes cannot be executed in <hi>France,</hi> if the King conſent not to it; and beſides, that the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath no power over the Poſſeſſory right of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</item>
               <item>X. The Popes give not only Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in <hi>commendum</hi> to Clerks, diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

It is enough to declare, that the Child is deſigned for a Church-man: <hi>Infantem qui, ut accepimus, in ſecundo vel tertio ſuae aetatis anno conſtitutus, &amp; ad vitam Eccleſiaſticam agendam deſtinatus exiſtit.</hi> But ſince no man can enjoy a Benefice, but he that is a Clerk; and that on the other hand, the Child is not as yet of Age, the Popes uſe theſe terms in their Bulls: <hi>Eidem Infanti, cum primum Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricali charactere ritè inſignitus, &amp; in ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate legitimâ conſtitutus, ſeu alias ex conceſſione &amp; diſpenſatione Apoſtolicâ ad Monaſteria obtinenda capax &amp; habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis fuerit, per eum, quoad vixerit, tenen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da; regenda &amp; gubernanda, ita ut ex nunc, prout ex tunc, pro eo affecta &amp; deſtinata ſunt ac eſſe cenſeantur, &amp;c.</hi> Then the Pope, in the ſame Bull, names a Steward, who ſhall take care only of the Temporal, until the Child be grown up and ſhaven.

Though Ordinaries may unite ſmaller Benefices,<note place="margin">Of Unions.</note> yet it only belongs to the Pope to annex Benefices which are called Conſiſtorial, nay and many times application is made to him for all ſorts of Unions. That Power of the Pope, of uniting all ſorts of Benefices, proceeds from the fulneſs of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; whereas that of Ordinaries is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited.

It is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54276:89"/>not, for all that, to be imagined that the Pope is ſo much Maſter of Unions in <hi>France,</hi> that he can make them at his pleaſure, and without lawful cauſe: For the Unions which are commonly called perſonal, and only made during the lives of ſome perſons, are not admitted there, becauſe ſuch kinds of Unions are not for the Benefit of the United Churches. It is then neceſſary to make Unions lawful, that they be grounded on true cauſes, and not upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts? Otherwiſe they are null, conform to the Decree of the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> which reſcinds Unions made by the Pope<note n="(1)" place="margin">Si non ex rationalibus cauſis &amp; veris factae fuerint, licet Apoſtolicae ſedis auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas intervene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

                  </note> if they be not ſupported by good reaſons. It is not ſufficient, for all that, that the Pope in the Bull of Union make uſe of theſe words, <hi>Et ex certa ſcientia noſtrâ:</hi> But he ought to direct to ſome Body upon the place a Reſcript of Delegation <hi>ad effectum uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis.</hi> That information may be had of the uſefulneſs of the Union.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54276:90"/>of his Right. There are many other Formalities to be obſerved, for making Unions valid in <hi>France,</hi> where in reality the plenitude of the Popes Power is acknowledged;<note place="margin">The Popes Power li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> but ſtill with reſervation of the liberty of limiting it according to the Laws of the Kingdom. And upon that ground the Parliaments inſiſt when they reſcind Unions that want the Formalities, and declare them abuſive. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi>

                  </note> hath alſo declared, that Unions made within 40 years ſhould be null, unleſs they had been made in preſence of the Ordinaries, for juſt reaſons, and thoſe who were concerned cited. But by the addition of theſe words,<note n="(2)" place="margin">Niſi aliter a ſede Avoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum fuerit.</note> if the Holy See hath not declared otherwiſe, it renders the Pope abſolute Maſter of Unions; which is not received in <hi>France,</hi> where no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is had to the Preſcription of forty years; for remedy may be had even after an hundred years againſt an Union that hath not been made in Form, if we believe the <hi>French</hi> Practitioners in Law.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54276:90"/>of Union have been ſurreptitious or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptitious: That is to ſay, if the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that hath been given to the Pope, be not found to be true; and that is common to Apoſtolick Bulls and Reſcripts, where that clauſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuppoſed,<note n="(1)" place="margin">Si preces veritati nitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> if the Petition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the truth.</item>
               <item>XII. There is another kind of Union that belongs alſo to the Pope alone, to wit, the ſuppreſſion of one Order for uniting it to another, or the Diſunion of two that had been united. Yet that cannot be done without the conſent of the King.</item>

The Pope then, does all now-a-days, by means of his Briefs, Bulls and Reſcripts, which, never the leſs cannot be of force without the Kings Permiſſion. And therefore it is, that the Depoſing of Biſhops in <hi>France,</hi> depends abſolutely on the Pope and King. The Pope names Commiſſioners to be Judges of the Proceſs, and the King accepts them. I know a great many oppoſe that in <hi>France;</hi> but it is in vain to object Law againſt matters of fact and examples, when the Queſtion is about Diſcipline. I ſhall ſay nothing of Ancient Cuſtoms, becauſe I treat on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here of what is practiſed at preſent.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoken of the Popes Power in <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Power of Legats in <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> in reference to beneficial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it will not be amiſs to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Power of his Legats and <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s. The Power of Legats which are called <hi>à latere,</hi> is very great, becauſe they are, as it were, the Popes Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, and repreſent his Perſon at the Courts of Princes, to whom they are ſent about Extraordinary Affairs. Their Inſtructions are at length ſpecified in
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54276:91"/>the Letters which the Pope gives them; but they are not put in Execution, until the King hath approved the Legation: And beſides, the Kings Officers do not Regiſter the aforeſaid Letters of Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but with the Modifications and Reſtrictions that are added to them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pleaſure of the King, and the Liberties and Cuſtoms of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Legats then have almoſt the ſame power in all that concerns Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, as the Popes whom they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent have; and therefore they are very troubleſom to the Ordinary Collators during the time of their Legation, which laſts as long as the King pleaſes. There are nevertheleſs, ſome things which they cannot perform without ſpecial Orders from the Pope, ſuch as are the Tranſlations of Biſhops. Nor can they receive Reſignations <hi>in favorem,</hi> unleſs that be expreſly mentioned in their Inſtructions, and not limited or abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in the Reſtrictions that have been made of them; and therefore in that caſe the Bulls of their Legation, and the verification of them in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt be conſulted. Mr <hi>Doujat</hi> hath Printed ſome of them in his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54276:92"/>and amongſt others that of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Chigi,</hi> which may inform us of their power in <hi>France,</hi> where they exerciſe both the one and other Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that is to ſay, both the voluntary &amp; the contentious, but ſtill in Quality of the Popes Delegats, &amp; therefore their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction ceaſes, if the Pope happen to die during their Legation.

            <p>As to the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s in <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Power of <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s in <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> they have no Juriſdiction; they are looked upon rather as the Popes Envoys for Civil matters, than as Church-men. Nevertheleſs there is a Cuſtom intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, which hath been many times, and on ſeveral occaſions condemned, to wit, that the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> receives atteſtations <hi>de vita &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi> whereby he takes information
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54276:92"/>of the manners of thoſe who are nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the King to Conſiſtorial Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices. But that is an abuſe introduced by the very ſame perſons that have been nominated by the King. For, fearing that their Bulls might not be expeded at <hi>Rome,</hi> they cauſe an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation <hi>de vita &amp; moribus,</hi> to be made before the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s; whereas that atteſtation ought to be given by the Biſhop of the place where the perſons named to Benefices reſide. Afterward they might be recommended to the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> as the Popes Miniſter in <hi>France;</hi> which is ſometimes practiſed even by the Kings order. But private perſons have had their recourſe to the <hi>Nuncio</hi> for their ſecurity, and that Cuſtom is obſerved at preſent, notwithſtanding all the Remonſtrances that have been made to hinder that Juriſdiction of <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi>'s in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains now that we ſpeak of the Cardinals of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">of Cardinals.</note> and of their Priviledges: But ſeeing theſe Priviledges reſpect their private perſons, rather then the right of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that article may be omitted; nor ſhall we touch at it but by the by. The
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54276:93"/>name of Cardinal did not in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſignify a particular dignity, as it does at preſent, but only denoted the difference of Churches and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For Inſtance, the Canons of Cathedral Churches were for moſt part called Cardinals in <hi>Italy,</hi> to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from the Eccleſiaſticks of other inferiour Churches. The ſame name was alſo given to Prieſts, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and even to Subdeacons, when there was occaſion to diſtinguiſh them from the lower Clergy: But it was a Title much inferiour to the quality of a Biſhop: And therefore when one was made a Biſhop he retained no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Title of Cardinal. Matters are at preſent much altered; The dignity of Cardinal now a days, is the next to the Papacy, and they are in reſpect of the Pope, as Senatours, or Councillors, are in relation to him that preſides in the Senate. Nevertheleſs ſince the Papacy is become Monarchical, the Pope takes their advice meerly for Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but acts according to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. He makes uſe ſtill of theſe Terms, <hi>De conſilio fratrum,</hi> but it is moſt commonly to ſecure his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54276:93"/>after his death, eſpecially in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Revenues of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Chamber, which the Popes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of too abſolutely, the Cardinals not daring to oppoſe them. That which renders the Cardinals more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable than all other Church-Men is, that they chuſe the Pope, and may themſelves be choſen. They have ſtept into the rights of the Ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Clergy, to whom it belonged to chuſe their Biſhop, in the ſame manner as was obſerved in other Churches. Now, ſince the Juriſdiction of the Pope is much augmented by the New Canon Law, the Dignity of the Cardinals alſo who are his Councillors, is become greater, and that they may be honoured according to their dignity, they have many Priviledges granted them, which exempt them from the common Laws and Cuſtoms.</p>
            <p>They have ſix whole Months for beſtowing Benefices whereof they are the Collators, without any fear of being prevented by the Pope, who hath in their favours diſpenſed with his right of Prevention. Beſides, the Pope who daily derogates from the Rule <hi>de vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginti
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54276:94"/>diebus</hi> to favour <hi>Reſignees,</hi> does never derogate from it in prejudice of Cardinals in reſpect of Churches where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are the ordinary Collators; and that is a Priviledge ſingular to them. Neither are they ſubject to the Indults or Priviledges of the menbers of the Parliament of <hi>Paris:</hi> So that they are not obliged to beſtow upon the <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees</hi> or Priviledged the Benefices where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are the Collators, becauſe they have a Grant from the Pope, which gives them power of diſpoſing of their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to whom, and in what manner they pleaſe. Nevertheleſs the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris</hi> hath ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Sentence contrary to thoſe Priviledges of Cardinals, and hath fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the <hi>Indultees,</hi> by virtue of the nomination of the King, who they thought ought to be preferred before the <hi>Indultees</hi> of Cardinals. In fine, the common Rule, which ſays that Secular Benefices ſhould be given to Seculars, and Regular to Regulars, is of no force in reſpect of Cardinals who<note n="(1)" place="margin">Habent os apertum ad omnia Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.</note> in that quality can receive all kinds of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices.</p>
            <p>To have explained the right of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54276:94"/>Popes in <hi>France</hi> in reſpect of Beneficial matters, is not ſufficient to diſcover fully wherein the ancient Canon Law is abrogated, which gave Biſhops abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power in the Collation of Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; we muſt beſides that examine the right of other Collators, and Patro us whether Eccleſiaſtick or Laick; In a word, it is neceſſary to know the rights of all who are in preſent poſſeſſion of providing to Benefices, in what manner ſoever it be. It would ſeem that none have more reaſon to challenge that Right,<note place="margin">The Rights of Chapters.</note> than the Chapters of Cathedral Churches; for as heretofore they made but one body with the Biſhops, and were of their Council, ſo they had ſome ſhare in the Juriſdiction. Wherefore, when the Revenues were ſeparated, at the ſame time the Juriſdiction was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, eſpecially the gratuitous Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, or the Right of providing to Benefices; and I take that to be the true reaſon why Chapters are at preſent the Collators of ſome Benefices ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately from their Biſhop. They have even made certain Laws among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which are different according to the diverſity of places. Every Canon
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54276:95"/>preſents by turn to Benefices that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vacant in his week, or in the time that hath been allotted him in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidend which they have made among themſelves. Beſides that, dignified Canons can provide to Benefices that depend on their Dignities, whether in particular, or joyntly with other Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries; wherein the Cuſtom obſerved in every Chapter is followed. Care is to be taken though, that all ſorts of Cuſtoms be not authorized; for it may be, that Canons have made Agreements among themſelves, which are prejudicial to the Rights of private perſons; and there are but few that mind that Biſhops cannot call into queſtion that Right of Chapters,<note place="margin">The Original of Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> ſince they have agreed on both ſides by Tranſactions which were in their power to make. But that hath given occaſion to a very great corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which hath eſtabliſhed in the Church Benefices without any Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For the Canons are not only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from their Biſhops, but they have, beſides, every one taken his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue in particular, and minded the management of it. This is the cauſe that many Offices which were neceſſary

I ſhall here give ſome Inſtances of them, that the Original of theſe Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities or Benefices may be known, of which the Titulars for moſt part are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whether or not they be obliged to reſide on their Benefices I reckon then amongſt theſe Dignities, the Provoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of St. <hi>Martin</hi> of <hi>Tours,</hi> which are pretty numerous. Theſe Provoſtſhips were heretofore poſſeſſed by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Chapter, who were choſen to take the care of the Temporal of the Church: And ſeeing the Revenues of that Church were in ſeveral places, the care of them was committed to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent perſons, who had ſeverally the management of the Rents of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Quarters; and becauſe of that, they were called <hi>Praepoſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54276:96"/>Dignities, or ſimple Benefices, whereof the Titulars cannot be obliged to Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as heretofore they were, becauſe the obligation to reſide proceeded not from the Office of Provoſt, but of the Canonſhip which they enjoyed with their Provoſtſhip, that was not then a Benefice, but meerly a Commiſſion or Office. And in this manner alſo ought we to conſider the dignity of Treaſurer in ſeveral Cathedrals of the Kingdom, which in all likelyhood, was but an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that conſiſted in taking care of the Revenues of the Church, and is at preſent a Benefice without Office, which is called a dignity of honour, becauſe it is only by Cuſtom that it hath the name of dignity, there being none but the Titles of Arch-Prieſt and Arch-Deacon that are dignities of right, by reaſon of the Juriſdiction which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>It is the ſame with all other digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or <hi>Sine-cure</hi> Parſonages, &amp; therefore I ſhall inſiſt no more on that Subject. I ſhall only obſerve, that ſeveral Perſons do in ſome manner enjoy two Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, though they be not reckoned amongſt thoſe who poſſeſs plurality of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54276:96"/>Livings. The Deans, for Inſtance, of Cathedral Churches, and the chief Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitaries of Collegiat Churches, have double the Revenue of the other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, though they be no more in effect, but Canons as the reſt are, and have nothing over them but a Prerogative of honour. But Cuſtom, which hath made that and many ſuch other practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces familiar to us, is the cauſe why they are not reckoned in the number of thoſe who have ſeveral Benefices; beſides, they may alledge for their Juſtification, the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith. <hi>That the Elders who Rule well are counted worthy of double honour.</hi>

            <p>It is true that according to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Canon Law, the Clerks of Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals, who have ſince been called Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons depended on their Biſhops, as well as the reſt of the Church-men: But that hindred them not from being the Biſhops Counſellers, who in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning did nothing conſiderable without the Counſel, nay even the conſent of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54276:98"/>their Clergy. Biſhops, nevertheleſs, at preſent queſtion moſt part of their rights, and accuſe the Canons<note n="(1)" place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpatae alienae Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionis.</note> of uſurpation. The Parliaments favour the Biſhops, becauſe they are perſwaded that the Juriſdiction which is called Epiſcopal, belongs by the Canon Law to the Biſhop alone, and that the Canons can have no ground but the Exemptions and Privledges which they have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Popes, or which they enjoy by virtue of tranſactions made with Biſhops, who could not do prejudice to the rights of their Succeſſours in what concerned Epiſcopal Juriſdiction, becauſe it cannot be communicated to others than Biſhops, and that in every Church there is but one Epiſcopal Chair,<note n="(2)" place="margin">Nulla eſt eathedra niſi Epiſcopalis.</note> the Seats of Canons being but Benches in the Quire for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Divine Service. But in my Judgment, Chapters which are founded on the Canon Law, have not Juſtice enough done them in that particular; and the Seats of Canons or Ancient Clerks were not in the beginning bare Benches for ſinging in the Quire, but Chairs of Juriſdiction, ſince the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers give them the name of Senators,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54276:98"/>comparing the Aſſembly of a Biſhop with his Clergy to a <hi>Senate.</hi> The tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions therefore, that they have made with their Biſhops ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as agreements which they had power to make, and not as mere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſions of Biſhops in favours of Chapters. Beſides, the Exemptions that Chapters have obtained from Popes, ought to be preferred before all other Exemptions, becauſe theſe Priviledges are very many times but a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their right. I know that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath derogated from the tranſactions of Chapters with their Biſhops, unleſs they have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Popes, and that it hath alſo annulled their exemptions: But beſides that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in <hi>France,</hi> where Exemptions grounded on good Titles are ſtill in force, it may be ſaid that the Biſhops in that Council have not done the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons Juſtice, and that as to the Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dats and Agreements which they have made with Biſhops concerning Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, they had right and power to make them. And therefore it was not in the Biſhops power to annul the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54276:99"/>ſame, but only to ordain a review, that it might be examined whether any thing had been done in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Canons, and whether they have not been Simoniacal.</p>
            <p>If the Rule of the Canon Law were exactly obſerved,<note place="margin">The Rights of Chapters during the Vacancy of the See.</note> it would be eaſie to regulate the Rights of Chapters during the Vacancy of the See; becauſe the Juriſdiction being common to the Biſhop and Chapter, it muſt needs be that the Chapter ſucceed to the whole Juriſdiction after the death of the Biſhop, and that by conſequent it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to all Benefices until the See be filled. But the contrary is practiſed: for the Benefices which the Biſhop confers with his Chapter, are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the Benefices to which he preſents alone. In regard of the firſt, as the Chapter beſtows them joyntly with the Biſhop, ſo does it retain the Right of conferring them alone, during the Vacancy of the See: But it diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not of others, as it is expreſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the 31th Book of the Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals<note n="(1)" place="margin">Tit. <hi>9.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi>

The reaſon of that practice is, becauſe the Right of conferring paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes then to the next Superiour; and it cannot be ſaid, that the Chapter is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, nor even equal to its Biſhop, in the Benefices to which the Biſhop pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents alone. However, I think, if mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had been examined to the bottom, the Chapters might confer all Benefices, <hi>ſede vacante,</hi> becauſe then they would re-enter into their Ancient Right after the death of their Biſhop. It hath not been minded, that that Decretal was made for the profit of the Pope, who happens often enough during the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of the See, to be immediate Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour; and ſo in ſome ſenſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Ordinary.

It would be then neceſſary, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Maxim, to reſerve all the Collations which are called free, to the Biſhop who is to ſucceed; but that is not obſerved in <hi>France,</hi> where the King hath his Right of the <hi>Regale,</hi> and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54276:100"/>preſents to all Benefices that have no Cure of Souls, until the See be legally filled; and for other Benefices they are provided to in the manner as I have juſt now mentioned.</p>
            <p>We are now to explain the Rights of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,<note place="margin">The Rights of Patrons.</note> which have alſo derogated much from the Ancient Right of Biſhops, on whom all the Churches of their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes depended abſolutely, and without any reſtriction. They are called Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of a Church, who have founded, or endowed it; ſo that there may be ſeveral Patrons of one and the ſame Church, becauſe of different Benefits, for which the Church is obliged to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſons, whether for having built it, or for having beſtowed the Ground whereon it is founded, or for having allotted Lands or Poſſeſſions, for Maintenance of the Miniſters that ſerve the Cure of the ſame. All theſe things acquire to the Benefactors a Right which is called the Right of Patronage; and though it doth not clearly appear by the Deed of the Foundation, that they have reſerved to themſelves that Right, yet ſtill they have it, provided they have not renounced the ſame.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54276:101"/>The Patrons enjoy ſeveral Honours and Priviledges by virtue of their Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage; the chief is the Right of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the Biſhop, or other Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Collator Clerks to be provided to the Benefices whereof they are the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons: And if they whom they preſent be capable, the Collator cannot refuſe them; he is obliged to give to the Preſentees Collation or Inſtitution upon the Letters of Preſentation: And if it happen that ſlighting the Patrons, they give the Benefices to others, the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are null. Now, that Preſentation which is the chief advantage of Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, hath been granted long before the Eſtabliſhment of the New Law, and of Benefices, to thoſe who founded Churches, and maintained Miniſters: For Biſhops Ordained for the ſame Churches, thoſe who were recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them by the Founders, when they were capable of the Miniſtry to which they were called.<note place="margin">Novell.

Yet that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not Patrons from conſidering it as an honourable Right: And though it be the Inſtitution or Collation that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54276:102"/>inveſts the Beneficiaries in their Benefices, <hi>quia praeſentatio non eſt pars ſubſtantifica Inſtitutionis, ſed eſt tantum quaedam ſervitus beneficii;</hi> yet it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways true that the Inſtitution or Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Biſhops, is not altogether in their own power in reſpect of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices that are in Patronage, becauſe they are limited to give the Inſtitution to thoſe who are preſented to them by the Patrons.</p>
            <p>There are two ſorts of Patrons, Laick, and Eccleſiaſtical; and though the right of Nomination to Benefices whereof they are the Patrons, be common to both, yet they differ in many things, and Lay Patrons have even ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over the Eccleſiaſtical.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I.<note place="margin">The Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Lay-Patrons.</note> The Pope nor his Legate can never derogate from the right of Lay Patrons and they who favour the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſay only that the Pope might abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, if he would, do it, ſeeing he is Maſter of all Benefices, but that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will. And therefore neither the Pope nor his Legate, can ever prevent Lay-Patrons, who have four Months entire for preſenting to Benefices. 'Tis true Eccleſiaſtical Patrons have fix
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54276:102"/>Months, for providing to the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of their Patronage; but that is uſeleſs to them in <hi>France,</hi> where the Prevention of the Pope takes place. In <hi>Normandy</hi> Lay Patrons have full ſix Months to preſent in, as well as Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks: But that Priviledge is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Cuſtom, and not on Law, that only allows four Months to Lay-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, which being expired they loſe their right of Preſentation for that time, the ſame being devolved on the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who beſtows the Benefice on whom he pleaſes.</item>
               <item>II. The King cannot derogate from the right of Lay-Patrons by his right of the <hi>Regale,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Regale</hi> gives him no more right, than the Papacy gives the Pope. Now it is certain, the Pope, as we have obſerved, can do nothing in prejudice of Lay-Patrons: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the King can derogate from the right of Eccleſiaſtical Patrons during the <hi>Regale,</hi> and confer the livings that depend on them, without any neceſſity of having their conſent: And as the <hi>Regale</hi> gives the King right to receive Reſignations <hi>in favorem,</hi> in the ſame manner as the Pope enjoys it, ſo
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54276:103"/>upon ſuch Reſignations, he can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Benefices Vacant within the <hi>Regale.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>III. The Lay Patron has liberty to alter. If he hath preſented an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſon, he can name another; which is not granted to an Eccleſiaſtick, who cannot accumulate Preſentation upon Preſentation, as a Lay Patron can. The reaſon of that difference is chiefly, becauſe the ignorance of a Lay Patron is to be excuſed, but not of an Eccleſiaſtick, who, in ſuch a caſe, forfeits his right, for that time, after the firſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation.</item>
               <item>IV. The Ordinary cannot admit of Preſentations without the conſent of the Lay Patron: Whereas he may do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Eccleſiaſtical Patron, from whoſe Right he can derogate in caſe of Permu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but not in pure &amp; ſimple Demiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; for the Benefice being then vacant, the Ordinary cannot confer it, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Preſentation of the Patrons, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Eccleſiaſticks, or Laicks.</item>
               <item>V. A Benefice in Lay-Patronage cannot be burdened with a Penſion or Annuity and Mr. <hi>Charles Du Moulin</hi> is of the Opinion, that the Popes Reſcript
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54276:103"/>cannot be put in execution, unleſs the Patron conſent to it, or that clauſe be added, <hi>Si tamen Patroni conſenſus acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat.</hi> But ſeeing the Pope can Derogate from the right of Preſentation of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Patronss by conferring in full right Benefices that are in their nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; he can upon ſtronger reaſon, Authoriſe by his Reſcripts, Penſions ſetled upon the Benefices of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, without any neceſſity of having their conſent.</item>
            </list>
            <p>After all, it will not be amiſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,<note place="margin">Whence cometh the diſtinction of Patronages.</note> that the diſtinction of Patrons Laick and Eccleſiaſtical, is not taken from the difference of perſons; for a Church Man may be a Laick in reſpect of his Lands and Inheritance, to which the Patronage is annexed: But a Lay-Man cannot be an Eccleſiaſtical Patron, becauſe Eccleſiaſtical Patronage is a right that belongs to a Perſon or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, by reaſon of Benefices which they enjoy. In a word, Benefices are in Eccleſiaſtical Patronage, when they depend on a Church. I do not here examine, whether the Pope can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with a Laick for enjoying a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, and ſtill remaining Laick; in
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54276:104"/>which caſe it would be true, that a Lay-Perſon might be an Eccleſiaſtical Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron. It is ſufficient that we have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined matters according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of Law; and without any farther inquiry into the thing, it will be eaſy to diſtinguiſh theſe two Patrona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, according to the Principles that we have laid down. We muſt, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, obſerve, That it many times happens Lay-Patronages, in proceſs of time, to become Eccleſiaſtical; and that either by the terms of the Donation or by the Tranſlation and Donation that Lay-Men make of their Lands and Lordſhips to Churches or Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. In the Title of the Foundation of a Church, it is ſometimes expreſſed that the Founders reſerve to themſelves the Right of Patronage, only for a certain time, and for a limited degree of Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; and then that failing, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in full right confers the Benefices that were before in Lay-Patronage. Wherefore it is neceſſary that Biſhops examine the Titles of foundations, which are ſometimes qualified with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions in their favours. Beſides, we find that Cathedral Churches and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54276:104"/>Monaſteries enjoying a great many Lordſhips with Patronages annexed to them, theſe Patronages have changed their nature, being become Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal by the Lords making of them over to Churches. We muſt nevertheleſs, except great Benefices, ſuch as Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks and Abbeys, which the Kings of <hi>France</hi> can never transfer to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers of Crown <hi>Lands.</hi> The King can only transfer the Patronage of ſmaller Benefices with the Inheritance; and then the Patronage from Royal becomes Eccleſiaſtical, if it be given or transferred to a Church.</p>
            <p>There ariſe great difficulties in <hi>France</hi> about Lay-Patrons who make profeſſion of the Reformed Religion.<note place="margin">Of Huguenot Patronage.</note>And ſeeing Proteſtants are not treated according to the Rigour of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Laws, which deprive Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of their Eſtates, it would ſeem that ſince they are left in poſſeſſion of their Lands and Lordſhips, they ſhould alſo enjoy all the fruits and honorary Rights that are annexed to the ſame Lord ſhips eſpecially according to the Maxims of the New Law, which<note n="(1)" place="margin">Collationes ſunt in fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious.</note> places the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation to Benefices in the number of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54276:105"/>Fruits. No man doubts but that Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage is a real Right annexed to Lands, and that by conſequent it follows them as being a fruit of the ſame. It would ſeem, then, that no regard ought to be had to the Quality of the perſon; in as much as the Right of Patronage is not perſonal, but real; and beſides, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation is but a ſervitude of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, and not a Spiritual Title. Nor doth the Preſentation properly give the Benefice. But inſtitution muſt be had from the Ordinary upon the letters of Preſentation; and in that the Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity does really conſiſt. The Ordinary may refuſe thoſe who are preſented by the Patrons, if they be not capable; and ſo it remains always in the liberty of Ordinaries not to ſupply Benefices that are in Huguenot Patronage but with fit and able men. The Patrons, then, if they would, cannot abuſe their Right, and it is impoſſible, that the Church can thereby receive any prejudice, if the Ordinaries diſcharge their duty.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many more reaſons that might be brought upon that Subject, were the cauſe that Lay-Patrons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54276:105"/>the Reformed Religion obtained heretofore an Order of Council, whereby they were allowed to nominate fit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who in their place might preſent to the Benefices of their Patronage; but that is not now obſerved; for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries, in full Right confer ſuch Benefices, ſo long as the Patrons make profeſſion of the Reformed Religion. And therefore it is fit we ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Right of Patronage, which is real and united to the Land, is not loſt, but only dormant and in ſuſpenſe; ſo that if the Patrons happen to be reconciled to the Church, they enjoy their Right of Patronage, in the ſame manner as if they had never profeſſed the Reformed Religion. That Cuſtom is backt with good reaſons; and though the Right of Patronage be not properly Spiritual, it is, at leaſt, mixt, and it is a common ſaying, that it is <hi>quid Spirituale annexum Temporali.</hi> And that it cannot be Sold ſeparately, but only with the Land or Inheritance to which it is annexed. It is true, Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage is a real Right; yet that hinders not but that it is exerciſed by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Now it is ridiculous, that a man
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54276:106"/>who believeth not in the Church, ſhould preſent to it a perſon for a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Right, and that that Right ſhould be granted upon his Preſentation. Grant that the Biſhop is free to accept or reject him who is preſented, and that he is the Judge of his capacity. That is not enough: For if the Canons prohibit the giving of a Benefice upon the recommendation of an Heretick, upon ſtronger reaſon, it ought not to be given upon his Preſentation. The Biſhop can only Judge of defects that are known to him, and it may be the Proteſtant Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron may preſent a very capable man, but who may have ſecret engagements with himſelf. It is not ſtrange to ſee Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who have followed their ſtudies at the charge of Proteſtant Patrons, in hopes of procuring them Benefices of their Patronage, to the end they may comply with them, and do prejudice to the Rights of the Church. But theſe Artifices are ſo hidden, that few can come to the knowledge of them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Patrons who profeſs the Reformed Religion, have with reaſon been excluded from the Right of preſenting to Benefices which depend on their
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54276:106"/>Patronage. It may be doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops in defect of theſe Patrons, who are incapable of preſenting to Benefices of their nomination, ought in full Right to confer the ſame Benefices. It would ſeem, that that did belong to them by Canon Law, becauſe the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage which is a kind of ſervitude tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Church, ceaſing, the Biſhops enter again into their ancient Right. But on the other hand, ſeeing Lay-Patrons enjoy not the right of Patronage, but becauſe of their Lands and Inheritances, there is a great deal of appearance, that it belongs to the King who is their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord, to ſupply the defects of his Vaſſals, when they themſelves can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exerciſe a Right that is annexed to their Fiefs; In the ſame manner as the King in <hi>Normandy</hi> has the Right of Wards, and that by virtue of that Right he is Patron in the place of the <hi>Minors,</hi> who have Lands with right of Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, until they be of age. However, It is certain that the Biſhops are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in poſſeſſion of that right, and that they are grounded upon a declaration of the King, which they pretend to be in their favours. There happened lately
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54276:107"/>a Proceſs betwixt the King and the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Rouen</hi> concerning the Cure of <hi>Oinville,</hi> which is in Huguenot Patronage, and to which both the King and Arch-Biſhop had preſented; which ſhews plainly enough, that the King had a mind to recover his right, having referred that matter from his Council to be examined in the great Council. After all, the Patrons profeſſing the Reformed Religion, have found a device to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Right of Patronage; For by a counterfeit Contract they ſell their Lands with Patronages to ſome Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of their Friends or Relations; And ſo they remain Maſters, unleſs the Fraud of their Contracts be diſcovered. But let us now come to Eccleſiaſtical Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages.</p>
            <p>Eccleſiaſtical Patronages derive their Original from the I. Council of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Original of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Patrona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> where Biſhops that found Churches out of their Dioceſes, are permitted to preſent capable Perſons to them, who are afterward to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Dioceſan Biſhops. That Right hath paſt inſenſibly to all other Founders: And at length, regular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities have alſo preſented to Benefices
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54276:107"/>depending on their Monaſteries. In their favours the Rule hath been made, which bears that Secular Benefices ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Seculars, and Regular to Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. By Law all Benefices ought to belong to Seculars, becauſe none but Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are by right capable of Eccleſiaſtick Employments, and that the Religious have only got into them by Priviledge and Diſpenſation. But ſince they have been permitted to poſſeſs Lands; Nay Fiefs and Lordſhips, they have had many Churches in their diſpoſal, which they have governed themſelves, or committed to Secular Prieſts. They commonly gave Pariſh-Churches to be governed by Secular Prieſts, allowing them but a very moderate Stipend; and had even the power to change them as they pleaſed. But at length they were forced to place Curates, or perpetual Vicars in their Churches, for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a vaſt number of Abuſes; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from thence we have the Cures to which they preſent in Quality of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons.<note place="margin">The Original of Priories.</note>As to Priories and other Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to which they nominate, they were at firſt but Adminiſtrations, or Manual Benefices, which, for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54276:108"/>were called Obediences, becauſe the Religious were employed in thoſe Offices by the command of their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots or Superiours, whom they were obliged to obey; and they continued no longer in the Employments, than their Superiours pleaſed. They had the name of <hi>Praepoſiti,</hi> or <hi>Obedientiarii,</hi> and their Care extended more to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral than the Spiritual. If Lands lay remote from the Monaſtery, ſome Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious were to be ſent thither to take the care of them: And ſeeing Monks ought not to live alone, unleſs they were Hermites or Anchorites, they had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions aſſigned them, of which one took the Title of <hi>Praepoſitus,</hi> and the places where they lived were called <hi>Cellae, Grangiae, Obedientiae,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from the Principal Monaſtery of which theſe Houſes were but Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances. This is the Original of Priories, and other leſſer Benefices of Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which in the beginning were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual and in Rule. Nay, it ſeems even contrary to the Inſtitution of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick life, that Monks ſhould proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſs Benefices in Title, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that they are Eſtabliſhed by the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54276:108"/>New Law; for they are the abſolute Maſters of their Revenue, which is in ſome ſenſe contrary to the Vow of Poverty that they have made. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, many of theſe Priories have been conferred on Seculars, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe of the ſcandalous Lives of the Religious that poſſeſſed them, or for other reaſons; and by that means the Benefices are gone out of the Rule. Forty years poſſeſſion is enough to change the nature of Benefices. In the mean time the Monks who perceive that theſe Benefices are by their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation regular, uſe all poſſible Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to recover them again, and ſpare no means to get them out of the hands of the Seculars who poſſeſs them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſuaded that they cannot commit Injuſtice nor Simony in regaining the Lands which they pretend belong to their Church. When Benefices are once in poſſeſſion of Monks, it is hard for them to return again to Seculars, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as we have obſerved before, after forty years poſſeſſion they become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular. On the contrary, it happens often, that Benefices poſſeſſed by Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, fall under Rule, becauſe Regular
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54276:109"/>Communities compound with Seculars, by Penſions, Annuities, or other ways. We have then general Rules for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Benefices in Rule, from thoſe that are not, to wit, forty years poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; and failing that Rule, all Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of their own nature, and by Canon Law, are Secular. Nothing but the Foundation can prove a Benefice to be in Rule; and then the Title of the Foundation derogates from the Ancient Canon Law.</p>
            <p>Though it be certain,<note place="margin">The Right of Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Abbots in the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices.</note> that Religious, and Regular Communities preſent to many Benefices in Quality of Patrons, yet there is great difficulty, to know to whom that Right of Patronage belongs ſince the Eſtabliſhment of perpetual <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendums:</hi> And there happen many ſuits upon that account betwixt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatary Abbots and the Monks. Yet it is an eaſy matter to reſolve all theſe difficulties, if we lay down ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that cannot be queſtioned. We muſt not conſider then the Modern <hi>Commendums</hi> as bare Conſignations, but as real Titles, as all the Bulls of <hi>Commendum</hi> bear. If the <hi>Commendums</hi> were no more but bare Conſignations,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:54276:109"/>the Commendataries could not have, as is commonly ſaid, <hi>Jus in re,</hi> but barely the keeping, or <hi>Cuſtodiam Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendae;</hi> and by conſequent they could not diſpoſe of Benefices, becauſe ſuch kinds of <hi>Commendums</hi> or Conſignations are only for a certain time. It is not ſo with the <hi>Commendums</hi> now in queſtion, becauſe they are <hi>ad vitam,</hi> and retain nothing but the name of <hi>Commendum,</hi> being in effect, real Titles, which give to Comendatary Abbots all the Rights which Regular Abbots enjoyed, to whom they have ſucceeded. That Principle, which is unqueſtionable, being ſuppoſed, it is plain enough to whom the Right of Patronage belongs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Abbot alone, or to the Monks Jointly with him. There needs no more for that, but to conſult the Right of the Regular Abbots of every Order. If the Conſtitutions and Cuſtom of the Order attribute to the Abbot alone the honorary Rights, there is no doubt but the Abbot <hi>Commendatary</hi> ought to enjoy the ſame Rights. If, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Regular Abbot cannot enjoy theſe Rights but with conſent of the Community, and that he be not the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54276:110"/>Maſter of them; they muſt be divided betwixt him and his Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in the ſame manner as temporal goods are: For then the Rule gives to the Monks the ſame power in reſpect of their Abbot; as the Canon Law gives to Canons in regard of their Biſhop. We muſt, nevertheleſs, take notice, that it is not enough to eſtabliſh the Right of Monks, that the Abbots have taken the counſel, or even the conſent of the Community, when there has been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of nominating to Benefices, for many may have done that, without any obligation upon them from their Conſtitutions: But it muſt beſides, be made out, that their Nominations would have been null without the conſent of the Community. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that Maxim is, becauſe the Canon Law and Popes Bulls give all the honorary Rights to Abbots; and ſo there is no derogating from them but for great reaſons. It is certain, the firſt Monks were entirely ſubject to their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots in all that concerned their Functions and Employments. St. <hi>Benet</hi> hath alſo reſerved to the Abbot that Superiority over the Religious: And when that
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54276:110"/>Order began to receive Lands, and that it was neceſſary to give the charge of them to ſome Monks in particular, the Abbot alone gave them their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which were at firſt but Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, though ſince they are become Benefices. I make no doubt but the Popes Bulls, which are very favourable to Commendatary Abbots, are founded on that Ancient Right of Regular Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots: But as to what concerns Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral goods, the ſame Bulls of the Pope do not allow them to be alienated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they belong to the whole Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and not to the Abbot alone. And therefore when the queſtion is of ſelling or alienating any Lands or Poſſeſſions belonging to the Abbey, the Abbot is not then abſolute Maſter, but his Community muſt conſent to it. For the ſame reaſon Commendatary Abbots are obliged to divide the goods and Revenues of the Abbeys with the Monks or to give them Money to the value of their ſhare or Portion: And though they are very willing to reſt ſatisfied with a yearly penſion, yet they have ſtill the ſame Rights to the Lands and Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54276:111"/>It concerns them to have a care that they be not imbazeled in the hands of the Abbot, in as much as their Portion diminiſhing by the diminution of the Revenues of the Abbey, their Penſion would be leſſened at the ſame time. The Abbots themſelves cannot hinder the Monks from taking cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of the Leaſes which they make of the Lands of their Abbey, and from having always an eye over their actions, becauſe they have the ſame right that the Abbots have of enjoying the Revenues of the Monaſtery.<note place="margin">Agreements betwixt Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots and Monks.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That common Right of the Abbots and Monks in regard of the Temporal Profits of Abbeys has given occaſion to Agreements and Tranſactions that are made betwixt them for the partition of the ſame. In <hi>France</hi> the Revenue of the Abbey is divided into three parts, of which there is one for the Monks, one for the Charges, and a third for the Abbot. But the Abbots enjoy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly two parts, becauſe they oblige themſelves to defray the charges; and if they neglect to do it, a third part of the Revenue may be ſequeſtrated, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it be done. Upon that foot, it is
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54276:111"/>eaſy to decide the difficulties that might ariſe betwixt the Abbot and Monks about the diviſion of the Revenues: There needs no more, but to give a third part to the Monks, and two thirds to the Abbot, who is obliged to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of the Fabrick, payment of Tenths, and other Charges. As to the honorary Rights, they ought not to fall under a dividend, becauſe by the Canon Law they all belong to the Abbot alone, who may make them over either in whole or in part to his Monks. But that gratuitous Conceſſion does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the Rights of his Succeſſours, becauſe the Abbot can only diſpoſe during his life, of the Rights that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in his perſon; and the Monks cannot enjoy them after the death of him that hath granted them, becauſe that Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is no more in force. It is not the ſame as to Agreements or Tranſactions, becauſe all Tranſaction ſuppoſes the Right of two Parties who are agreed together; and ſo the agreement will always ſubſiſt in reſpect of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, though the Abbot be dead, until it be broken off by his Succeſſour. In <hi>France,</hi> Abbots may break the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54276:112"/>of their Predeceſſours, eſpecially if they think themſelves injured. We have many inſtances of that practice: And there ſeems to be reaſon for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe Abbots may make ſecret Compacts with the Monks; and take the advantage of ſuch, to the prejudice of their Succeſſours: And therefore the Abbots have right to break the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Predeceſſours. It is a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der matter to diſſolve thoſe Tranſactions when they have been confirmed at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the Parliaments, with cognition of the cauſe; for then they become real, and by conſequent oblige the Succeſſours. In that caſe, the Abbots cannot reſcind the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordat or Agreement, till they have obtained a Reſcript from the Pope, and letters from the Parliaments upon a Bill preferred.</p>
            <p>Farthermore, we are to take notice that many times the partition of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary Rights is inſerted in the Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dats with the diviſion of the Revenues and eſpecially the Preſentations to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, as if that could be divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Abbot and Monks. It is a vicious clauſe in the Agreements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54276:112"/>it is of the nature of a Concordat, that they who Tranſact have ſome Right to the thing for which they do Tranſact; otherwiſe it is not an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a Conceſſion. This Maxim, which is undeniable, being ſuppoſed, it is eaſy to reſolve the difficulties that daily happen betwixt Biſhops and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious communities during the Vacancy of the Abbatial See.<note place="margin">To whom it belongs to preſent to Benefices du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of the Abbatial See.</note> The Ordinaries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide to Benefices that are vacant at that time, and the Monks alſo on their ſide, preſent; which daily occaſions great ſuits, and it ſeems that there is nothing as yet fixt and determined as to that. But according to the principle which we have laid down, there is no doubt but when the Religious Community preſents to Benefices jointly with the Abbot, they ought ſtill to preſent during the Vacancy, becauſe one of the Preſenters is enough in defect of the other. But when the Abbot alone nominates to Benefices, and he dies, the Ordinaries enter again into their Canonical Right, and confer in full power, becauſe the Patronage or Right of preſenting ceaſes by the death of the Patron.</p>
            <p>That right of Ordinaries, or of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54276:113"/>Communities, is not to be called Devolution: For Devolution hath no place, but when there is a neglect on the part of Patrons or Collators; and then their Right is devolved upon the immediat Superiour. In the queſtion we now examine, there is no neglect; and they who ſay that on thoſe occaſions the Right is devolved upon the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or upon the Chapter of the Monks, ſpeak very improperly. It is far better ſaid, that the Ordinary, or Chapter of the Monks provide then to Benefices by the Canon Law, and their own Right. In vain do the Monks object to Ordinaries, their Concordats, or the Rights of their Chapter, becauſe, as we have already obſerved, the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath no power <hi>ſede vacante,</hi> but as to Benefices where they preſent jointly with the Abbot: And as to the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Concordat, there can be none but for what belongs in common to the Abbot and Monks. Now the Preſentation to Benefices and other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary Rights being only in the perſon of the Abbot, they cannot fall under a dividend, and by conſequent no Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction can be made about them. To
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54276:113"/>this we may add, that Ordinaries have an acquired Right to all the Benefices of their Dioceſe, when there is no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron; for then they confer in full Right; and ſo Abbots cannot give a Right which is not their own.</p>
            <p>What we have ſaid of Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Abbots,<note place="margin">Of Priors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Monks.</note> ought alſo to be underſtood of Priors, who have Monks in their Priories; for the Diviſion of the Rents ought to be made in the ſame manner. It is worth the obſerving, that amongſt the Religious there are two ſorts of Priors, to wit Conventual Priors, and Clauſtral. The Clauſtral Priors govern the Abbey in abſence of the Abbot, and during the Vacancy of the Abbatial See, as it happens to be ſo long as the <hi>Commendum</hi> laſts. Conventual Priors are the Heads of Houſes dependant on Abbeys, in regard, that, as we have ſaid before, Monks were ſent to take the charge of the Revenues of theſe Houſes; and there was one amongſt them whom all the reſt obeyed, from whence at length, came the name of Prior. And it is from that that the ſimple Priories, as they are called now adays, becauſe they are ſeculariſed, and Chappels, derive
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54276:114"/>their Original. Now ſeeing ſome of theſe Priories became conſiderable, they were elective in the ſame manner as Abbeys were. And therefore they are in the Kings Gift, as well as the Abbeys; and the Pope in providing to them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves this difference only, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows Biſhopricks and Abbeys in full Conſiſtory, and Priories in Chamber. I have ſaid that Clauſtral Priors govern the Abbey during the time that it is in <hi>Commendum;</hi> which is to be underſtood of the Government in reſpect of Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick diſcipline: For though <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datary</hi> Abbots are ſubſtituted in the Rights of Regular Abbots, yet it hath not been thought fit to ſubject the Monks to them, in what concerns the Rule of their Inſtitution. However, they take the power of putting in and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Clauſtral Priors, according to the terms of their Bulls, which give them full authority over the Monks. But that power hath been qualified e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in reſpect of the Religious who live in Congregation, ſuch as are in <hi>France</hi> the Benedictin Monks of the Congregation of St. <hi>Maur,</hi> who elect their Clauſtral Priors. At firſt, every
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54276:114"/>Abbot was Supream in his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, and Independant of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Priors and other Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtral Officers depended ſolely on him: But the Reformations of <hi>Cluni</hi> and <hi>Ciſteaux</hi> introduced ſome alteration into the ancient Government.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cluni</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteaux</hi> have changed the Ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Monaſteries.</note>The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries that followed that Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preſently ſubmitted to the Abbots of <hi>Cluni</hi> and <hi>Ciſteaux,</hi> who were like the Generals of all the other Abbots and Priors, and by that means they became dependant on them.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Heads of Monaſteries, that they might be independant of the Biſhops, were exempted from their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, which made a kind of New Hierarchy in the Church: For whereas before the Monks depended on their Abbot, for the Rule, and for all the reſt, on the Biſhops in whoſe Dioceſes they lived, they made now a particular and diſtinct Body in the Church, which acknowledged no Biſhop but the Pope for Superiour; and for Government of that Body they eſtabliſhed a Form of little Councils, which they called Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Chapters: The Pope having granted to the Heads of theſe Orders
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54276:115"/>great Priviledges, which have in many things derogated from the Juriſdiction of Ordinaries. This Reformation hath been found ſo uſeful to keep Monks in their Duty, that it hath not only been received amongſt other Religious, who pretended an Exemption from holding ſuch Chapters, but is alſo augmented, eſpecially ſince the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which will have Monks live in Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. In this manner the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is called the Congregation of St. <hi>Maur,</hi> hath been eſtabliſhed in <hi>France,</hi> under the Popes <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. who in their Bulls of Erection gave power to that new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to aggregate thereunto the Monaſteries that would accept the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. And this hath wonderfully redounded to their profit; for they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs at preſent all the good Abbeys of the Kingdom. They depend not at all on the Biſhops, but immediately on the Pope, and they are governed by a General who is choſen every three years according to the Rules of the Canon Law. Beſides, they have Provincials, Aſſiſtants and Definitors, as the other Modern Religious have.</p>
            <pb n="215" facs="tcp:54276:115"/>
            <p>I mention this, that we may not meaſure the Rights of Commendatary Abbots according to the practice at preſent obſerved amongſt the Monks, but according to the Cuſtom that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed before theſe Reformations. The Popes, who make Commendatary Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, have in <hi>France</hi> taken ſome Rights from them, and given them to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious of the Congregation of St. <hi>Maur;</hi> for they give them not only liberty to chuſe Clauſtral Priors independently of the Abbot,<note place="margin">A Deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Rights of Commonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Abbots.</note> but have alſo united to the Conventual <hi>Menſae</hi> the Clauſtral Offices, which the Abbots had Right to diſpoſe of before the Reformation, as well as of all the Benefices of their Abbey. The power then of Commendatary Abbots over the Monks muſt be limited ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Bulls of Popes that have been received in <hi>France;</hi> and we muſt know wherein they have derogated from the Bull of <hi>Commendum,</hi> which gives Commendataries all power both in Spirituals and Temporals. By Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals Commendatary Abbots would have meant the Preſentation or Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Benefices, and the Juriſdiction in regard of the Monks. They pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:54276:116"/>that the appointing of Clauſtral Priors depended on them, that the Right of viſiting and correcting belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; and in a word, that being ſubſtituted into the Rights of Regular Abbots, they ought to have the ſame Authority and Juriſdiction.<note place="margin">Proſper Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nani.</note> But <hi>Fagnani</hi> relates a Bull of <hi>Innocent</hi> X. in favours of the Monks of <hi>Ciſteaux</hi> againſt a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatary Abbot, who took to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf all the Rights that we have juſt now mentioned. By that Bull it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that Commendatary Abbots ſhall exerciſe no Juriſdiction over the Monks; that the Abbot of <hi>Ciſteaux,</hi> and other Regular Abbots of that Order, ſhall viſit every one his own Diſtrict, or Commiſſionate Viſitors; and that the Spiritual Juriſdiction over Monks ſhall not be adminiſtred by Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datary Abbots. It meddles not with the Nomination or Collation of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, becauſe without doubt that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Commendatary Abbot, as it did before to the Regular, who in the beginning had a Soveraign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the Monks; and they, on the contrary, had none over him, as appears by a Letter of Pope <hi>Pelagius</hi> related by
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54276:116"/>
               <hi>Gratian,</hi> againſt the Monks, who under pretext that they had elected their Abbots, would needs turn them out, and chuſe others in their place who might comply with their manner of living.<note n="(1)" place="margin">Gratian. <hi>18.</hi> q. <hi>2.</hi> C. nullam.</note>

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54276:117"/>power to the Abbot, and not to the Monks.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay nothing in this place of the other Religious,<note place="margin">Of Regulars.</note> who are commonly called Regulars, becauſe much of what we have obſerved may be eaſily applied to them It is true in the Canon Law Monks and Regulars are pretty often diſtinguiſhed, but they are alſo many times comprehended under the ſame Rules; and that which makes them dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent is not conſiderable as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we treat of. The Canons themſelves who are called Regular, and who take the Title of Regular Clerks, lead at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a life that reſembles more that of Monks, than that of Clerks: For they live ſeparately in their Monaſteries, and are ſubject to their Abbots or Priors. They are no more in the Cathedral Churches under the direction of their Biſhops, and ſo far from being employed by them in Eccleſiaſtical Functions, they depend entirely on their Regular Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, who diſpoſe of their Perſons and Employments. And therefore it ought not to be thought ſtrange, that we reckon all Regulars in the number of Monks, becauſe they differ not from
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54276:117"/>them, as the learnedeſt Canoniſts have obſerved<note n="(1)" place="margin">Hoſtien. Panorm.</note> unleſs in certain Caſes expreſſed in the Law, <hi>exceptis caſibus in Jure expreſſis.</hi> This makes me think, that the Abbots or Priors of Canon Regulars ought by common Right, as well as Abbots amongſt Monks, to have all the government both in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals and Temporals, and that therefore it belongs to them to diſpoſe of all the Benefices and Offices of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities: But they have followed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that ſubjects them to Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, wholly oppoſite to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent common Right of Abbots. We ſee that the Abbot of St. <hi>Genevieve</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi> is elective, and that every three years they make a new Election. In a word, they live in Congregation, and have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Chapters, for ordering the more important affairs of their Order: Which differs much from the Ancient Rights of Abbots. Nor is it to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that if the Abbey of St. <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieve</hi> returned into <hi>Commendum,</hi> the Commendatary Abbots ought to be obliged to ſhare their Juriſdiction with the Religious: But they ought to reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Ancient Right of Abbots, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54276:118"/>only conſider wherein the Popes have derogated from it in favours of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious who live in Congregation. But as it hath been already obſerved, there is nothing take from Commendatary Abbots, but the Juriſdiction that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Monaſtick Diſcipline. Though I have often ſpoken of Commendatary Abbots, and of the Rights that belong to them, yet I thought it not proper to examine particularly, whether their Title be Canonical, becauſe that would have carried me from my ſubject; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient that the New Law hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed it.</p>
            <p>It is true in the beginning,<note place="margin">A compariſon betwixt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatary Abbots and Regular.</note> there was great crying out againſt <hi>Commendums;</hi> And there are ſtill a great many that cannot approve of them: But if a Hiſtory were made of Regular Abbots as there has been of Commendataries, we would find that there have been greater abuſes in the Church under Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Abbots, than there are at preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Commendatary. Commendatary Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots have but the third part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of their Abbeys in their diſpoſal: The ſecond part is appointed for the maintenance of the Monks, and the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54276:118"/>third for the charges of the Monaſteries. The Regular Abbots, on the contrary, had the diſpoſal of all the Revenues of their Abbeys, they ſtarved their Monks, and ſquandered away the Rents of the Monaſteries, by leading lives altogether inconſiſtent with their profeſſion. The difference then betwixt Abbots Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatary and Regular is, that the former enjoy but a third of the Abbey, and the whole was for the uſe of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. It is true Regular Abbots had not Bulls aſſigning them the Revenues of their Abbeys in <hi>utilitatem perſonae;</hi> but notwithſtanding they diſpoſed of them as if they had been properly their own: Whereas the Bulls of Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datary Abbots appoint the beſt part of the Revenue of Abbeys for the uſe of the Poor, the Monks and Churches. I am perſwaded that the Monks deſire not that Regular Abbots ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored with the ſame power they had before. If it were ſo, the Thirds which now they enjoy peaceably without any charges, would no longer be at their diſpoſal, but in the power of the Abbot, who would govern them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his humour. I aſſert nothing
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54276:119"/>but what hath been ſaid before me by the moſt zealous Benedictine Monks, who have often complained of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour wherewith their Abbots treated them, and of the profuſe diſſipation of the Revenues of their Abbeys. That I may not be tedious,<note place="margin">A Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Life of Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Abbots.</note> I ſhall only here report ſome words of the Abbot <hi>Trithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> upon that ſubject, and refer the Reader to the works that he hath made for the Reformation of his Order, and eſpecially of the Regular Abbots of his time.</p>

               </note>He upbraids them with want both of knowledge and piety, that they were wholly addicted to the World, and minded nothing but Riches &amp; Pleaſure.

               </note> and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54276:119"/>at the ſame time ſhews how much their Order was corrupted, after this manner beſpeaking them in an aſſembly: <hi>O vos Abbates idiotae, &amp; ſcientiae ſalutaris inimici, qui diem obſcaenis amoribus conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitis, qui vinum in ſaturitate bibitis, qui terrenis lucris intenditis, qui ad tabulam ſtolidi luditis; quid reſpondebitis Deo &amp; legiſlatori veſtro benedicto?</hi> That corruption was ſo univeſal, that he affirms that of Ten Thouſand Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, there were not a thouſand that any way obſerved the Rule of their Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but that the Abbots were wholly plunged in debauchery, <hi>voluptatibus carnis ſubmerſi,</hi> and he applies theſe verſes to them.</p>

            <p>This is the deſcription that the Abbot <hi>Trithemius</hi> makes of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54276:120"/>Abbots of his time in a Harangue that he ſpoke in their preſence; and in the ſame place he adds<note n="(1)" place="margin">Qui nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne reformati, re autem ipsâ deformati ſunt.</note> that they who called themſelves reformed were no better than the reſt.

               </note> the rigourouſneſs of Abbots to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Monks, whom they obliged to faſt, whil'ſt they themſelves feaſted with thoſe whom they invited to their Tables, and exempted themſelves from the uſual Faſts under pretext of Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. He upbrards them that they were not true Abbots, ſeeing they were not in place of Fathers to their Monks, to whom they denied what was neceſſary: <hi>Neceſſaria fratribus tuis alimenta ſubtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his, vilia &amp; inſipida largiris; tu optimo vino ſtomachum tuum ſatias, fratribus quod deterius eſt ſubminiſtras.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well conſidered, I don't think that the Monks who at preſent live under Commendatary Abbots, deſire to be again governed by Regular, who have uſed them more like Slaves than Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

            <p>In fine ſo exceſſive was the vanity of Monks and Abbots at that time, that as the ſame Author informs us, Monks would not be called Monks. They ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred ſo Sacred a name: <hi>Sanctum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men quaſi ſtultitiam abominantur.</hi> Nor would the Abbots be termed Abbots, they thought they were affronted, when that Title was given them. <hi>Abbatis noſtri nomen ſuum tanquam indignum ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicantes, gratioſi domini vocantur; &amp; ſi contigerit eos ſimiliter appellari domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos Abbates, indignantur, &amp; vocantem ſe

But what is ſtranger, they had more men in their Retinue, than the wealthieſt Biſhops had; and it many times happened that a poor wretch who had been choſen Abbot, had the Train of an Arch Biſhop: <hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>Ad Thermas ſumptuosè properas, ſocios &amp; ſocias vocas.</hi> This was the condition of Monaſteries and Regular Abbeys, when Commendataries were eſtabliſhed: And I leave it to the Reader to make the compariſon betwixt them. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:54276:121"/>not, for all that, to Juſtify the <hi>Commendum,</hi> nor the vices of Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datary Abbots. But it is my deſign only to ſhew that we muſt not always Judge of things, by the abuſe that men make of them; and that if the Hiſtory of the Abbot Regular were made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, as it hath been intended, all men would be perſwaded that Regular Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots have been no better men than Commendataries; and that it would be, in fine, a very bad Reformation in the Church, to reduce Abbeys again under Rule, in the manner as they have been formerly. It might be ſaid then <hi>erit noviſſimus error pejor priore.</hi> To make a profitable reformation to the Church, it would be neceſſary to go back to the moſt Ancient Canon Law, which ſubjects Monks to the Juriſdiction of Biſhops, and at the ſame time eſtabliſhes an independance amongſt the Houſes, as it was in the beginning. Every Monaſtery ſhould obey a Superiour or Abbot, and the Superiours or Abbots ſhould obey the Biſhops, who ought to viſit them as well for the Spiritual as Temporal. That would be the means to hinder
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54276:122"/>diſorder and the diſſipation of Revenues, of which a great part is ſpent in need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Journeys, and in holding general Chapters. But it is to no purpoſe to enlarge any more on this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which requires a particular treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Monks and Regulars we have ſpoken of,<note place="margin">Military Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> there is another ſort of Religious, who according to their Inſtitution, bear the name of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeraſalem,</hi> from whom deſcend thoſe that are called Knights of <hi>Malta.</hi> That Order is much different from other Religious, and their Benefices differ alſo from the nature of all other Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. They are rather the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations of Hoſpitals, than Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſices, and in effect, that Order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by an Hoſpital that was built at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the reception of thoſe who went to ſee the holy places. The founding of Hoſpitals for Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Strangers, is Ancient enough and there was either in the Biſhops Houſe or elſewhere, places appointed for that end, that the ſick might be taken care of, and other charitable works performed, for which part of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54276:122"/>the Revenue of every Church was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted: Afterward in proceſs of time they were diſtinguiſhed from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Revenue of Churches, and many private perſons gave Lands and Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances to be erected into places of piety in imitation of Monaſteries. They cannot be ſaid properly to be Benefices, becauſe the Rents of them are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for Church men, but for all men who are in miſery and want. And therefore there are as many kinds of Hoſpitals as there are calamities. In the beginning the Biſhop had the care of theſe Monaſteries, becauſe he ought to provide for the neceſſities of the Poor, and of all thoſe who were in miſery, as well as for the ſubſiſtance of Clerks. But the Religious of the Hoſpital of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> made a particular Body in the Church, which hath to this day its particular Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. To ſpeak properly there is but one Hoſpital in all the Order, and that Hoſpital is at preſent reputed to be in <hi>Malta.</hi> All other private Hoſpitals or Commanderies, are but members of that Hoſpital, on which they depend: And therefore their Revenue by Right,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54276:123"/>belongs to the common Treaſury of the Order.</p>
            <p>I think Commanderies may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the conventual Prieuries of Monks,<note place="margin">The Original of Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deries.</note> which in the beginning were only adminiſtrations of the Revenues of certain places diſtant from the principal Monaſtery. As Monks were placed in theſe Houſes to ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e care of the Rents, ſo alſo there hath been a neceſſity of ſending Knights into thoſe places where the Order had Lands. The name of <hi>Commander</hi> hath great reſemblance with that of <hi>Praepoſitus,</hi> which was given to Monks who managed the Rents of theſe remote Houſes. Beſides, their admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration was called <hi>Obedientia,</hi> becauſe they depended wholly on the Abbot, who gave them that Commiſſion. It is Juſt ſo with the ſimple Commanders of <hi>Malta,</hi> who are rather Farmers of the Order than Beneficiaries They have, nevertheleſs converted their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or Farms into a kind of Benetices, paying a certain acknowledgment to the common Treaſury of the Order; and that acknowledgement is called <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt put a difference then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54276:123"/>Hoſpitals which are by Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Secular, and Regular Hoſpitals that are poſſeſſed by Religious, ſuch as are the Commanderies we ſpeak of, which are appropriated to the Religious of the Order, and cannot be poſſeſſed by others. Nay it is neceſſary alſo, that thoſe of the Order be qualified for peaceable enjoying of them, and their Benefices are not all of the ſame nature. We muſt therefore obſerve, that there are amongſt them Knights, Chaplains, and ſerving Brothers, and that there are Commanderies, or Revenues aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to theſe three different qualities. There are beſides the great Officers, the firſt of whom is he that at preſent is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the great Maſter of the Order, and is the Head; who in the beginning was the Maſter of the Hoſpital: Under him are the great Officers of the Order, who are for moſt part Military Officers becauſe of the employments to which they are appointed, ſuch as the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, <hi>Mareſchal</hi> and others. I ſhall not ſpeak here of the Bayliffs or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventual Priors who are of the great Croſs, nor of their other Officers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Inſtitution of their Order and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54276:124"/>their Laws are Printed. I ſhall only add that it is to be obſerved, that though that Order be compoſed of ſo many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet it is but one only Convent divided into ſeveral Tongues. Every Tongue contains ſeveral Provinces, and in every province there is a great Prior who from time to time holds Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Chapters. For obtaining a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandery one muſt be of the Nation where the Commandery lies, have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his Caravans, which conſiſt in ſome years Services at <hi>Malta,</hi> and be of the quality requiſite for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandery, being beſides bound up by certain Statutes; But they are often diſpenſed with at the Recommendation of Princes, who have alſo made Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dats with the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> as well as with the Popes.</p>
            <p>There is another kind of Knights who alſo enjoy Church Lands,<note place="margin">A Military Order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one may marry.</note> and neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſeem neither to be Religious not Eccleſiaſticks, becauſe they are Married. They call themſelves, however, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and have their Laws as other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous have. In <hi>Spain</hi> the Commanders of the Orders of St. <hi>James,</hi> of <hi>Calatrava</hi> and <hi>Alcantara</hi> are of that nature.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:54276:124"/>There are in <hi>France</hi> alſo the Knights of St. <hi>Lazarus</hi> who may Marry. It is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty difficult though, to tell upon what Title theſe Married Religious poſſeſs Eccleſiaſtical Revenues; unleſs it be ſaid, that being by Profeſſion Religious, they ought to be obliged to Chaſtity: But that the Pope who according to the Maxims of the New Law, is Maſter of the Canons, has diſpenſed with that Obligation, and that by an Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Priviledge they may have Wives: Which is conform to the opinion of the ableſt Divines, who think that the Pope may for lawful cauſes diſpenſe with Monks as to their Vow of Chaſtity. The married Commanders of theſe Orders muſt then be reckoned amongſt Regulars, and they may in conſcience enjoy, under the Title of Regulars, Church Lands that are appropriated to their Order. This, at leaſt, is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion<note n="(1)" place="margin">Mart. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var.</note> of one the moſt learned and ſtrict Canoniſts of our age, who calls <hi>Philip</hi> II. King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the greateſt Prelate in the Church next to the Pope, becauſe he was the chief or great Maſter of the three Military Orders of <hi>Spain,</hi> and enjoyed a good part of the Tithes
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54276:125"/>of Churches within his Territories.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 11. the richeſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of the Church.</note> In this quality of Prelate Regular, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is the richeſt <hi>Beneficiary</hi> in his Kingdom: And ſeeing he is not only great Maſter of the Orders of St. <hi>James, Calatrava</hi> and <hi>Alcantara,</hi> but is alſo King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he can, as King, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to his own uſe the Revenues of his Commanderies, at leaſt as much as is neceſſary to make him live like a King. In the ſame manner as it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, according to the Maxims of the New Law, for Cardinals, Sons of Kings, Nobles and men of Letters to poſſeſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Benefices, that they may be able to live according to their quality.</p>
            <p>From all that hitherto hath been ſaid, it is eaſy to Judge how much the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Diſcipline hath changed in Beneficial matters, and how much the preſent practice differs from Ancient Cuſtoms. The Canon Law does, indeed give the entire diſpoſal of Church Revenues to the Biſhops within their ſeveral Dioceſes; but the new and particular Law takes from them the greateſt part of their power. Hoſpitals in the beginning depended on the Biſhops, as all other goods and Lands
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:54276:125"/>that were dedicated to works of Charity; they appointed men to take the care of them, and the adminiſtrators gave account of them. But by degrees they have loſt that Right, and even private perſons have poſſeſſed Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals in Title of Benefice. That Abuſe hath been corrected by the Councils of <hi>Vienne</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> which revived the Ancient Canon Law: But they are not received in <hi>France,</hi> as to that point that the Adminiſtrators ſhould give in their accounts before the Ordinaries. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſince the management of theſe Rents ſeems not to have any Spiritual relation, it has been thought more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to give the Adminiſtration of them to Laicks, who in ſome manner are in place of <hi>Guardians.</hi> Church-men are excluded from it, becauſe they might abuſe them, and apply them to their own uſe as Benefices belonging to themſelves. Nor have the Nobility and publick Officers any ſhare in that affair, becauſe it might be feared that they would render themſelves Maſters of the Revenues aſſigned to Hoſpitals. And therefore they chooſe moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly good and ſufficient Citizens, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54276:126"/>the right of nominating them belongs to the Founders. The Edict of <hi>Henry</hi> II. gave the Overſight and Viſitation of all the Hoſpitals of the Kingdom to the great Almoner of <hi>France:</hi> But <hi>Francis</hi> I. gave the ſame power to the Kings Judges of the places where the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals lay. It is true the Ordinaries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt that Edict, pretending that it is prejudicial to their Rights: But the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> took no notice of their oppoſition, farther then that it was decreed, that they might depute one or two on their part, to be preſent with the Kings Judges at the Viſitation, but with this condition, that they could not in any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict them. <hi>Henry</hi> II. made a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Edict, which is wholly conform to that of <hi>Francis</hi> I. Since that time the Ordinaries have no power over the Revenues of Hoſpitals, only they and other Church men are invited to be preſent at the making of the accounts. It is, nevertheleſs, to be obſerved that there are ſeveral Benefices which are real Titles, and yet called Hoſpitals, Gods Houſes, and Alms Houſes, and which in effect are not Hoſpitals, but
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:54276:126"/>ſo called for ſome particular reaſons which would be too long to relate. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Hoſpitals are ſometimes given in Title of Benefices, when they are no more but Acceſſories to a more conſiderable Benefice.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoken of the perſons in whoſe favour the Maxims of the New Law have derogated from the Canons and Ancient right of Biſhops,<note place="margin">Derogations from the Rights of Biſhops.</note> it remains now to ſpeak of the things that dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the ſame Right, and we ſhall begin with the Reſignations that are called in <hi>favorem.</hi> There are two ſorts of Reſignations. The firſt which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a pure and ſimple Reſignation is made in this manner: The Beneficiary does purely and ſimply reſign his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice into the hands of the Ordinary; and then the Benefice is void. That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, which may alſo be called Renunciation or Demiſſion, is Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and we have ſome inſtances of it in Antiquity; But Biſhops did not eaſily admit of it: They made examination whether they who would lay aſide Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Employments, had reaſons that obliged them to that Demiſſion; and if no lawful reaſon appeared, their
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54276:127"/>Reſignations on Demiſſions were not received. The other Reſignation which now-a days is far better known than the former, is called Reſignation <hi>in favorem;</hi> becauſe he that reſigns his Benefice, does it only on this condition, that it ſhall be given to him in whoſe favours he hath made the Demiſſion: and that if it be given to another the Collation ſhould be null.<note place="margin">The Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations <hi>in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorem.</hi>
               </note> This kind of Reſignation is ſo New, that there is no mention made of it in the Body of the Canon Law, in the Decretals, nor in the Sext. The New Canoniſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do all agree that it is Simoniacal, becauſe it includes a Paction or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to wit, that the Reſignation of the Benefice is not made but that the other may be inveſted who is named by the Reſigner. And therefore there was a neceſſity of having recourſe to the Pope to get a Diſpenſation for the Simony: And that is the reaſon why none but the Pope can receive thoſe Reſignations <hi>in favorem,</hi> becauſe he is above the Canons and Poſitive Law. Biſhops cannot admit of them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their power is limited, and that they cannot purge the Simony which is
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:54276:127"/>incurred by a compact. After all, there is nothing that derogates more from the Right of Ordinaries and Patrons, than that Reſignation <hi>in favorem,</hi> becauſe they who poſſeſs Benefices, diſpoſe of them in the ſame manner as of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances: And it ſurpriſes me to ſee it ſo common, that men of greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity make no Scruple by that means to render their Benefices hereditary in their families, as if the Popes diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion acquitted them always of Simony. Abbot <hi>Trithemius</hi> could not endure that the Monks of his time obtained ſuch Diſpenſations from the Pope<note n="(1)" place="margin">Trith. de ruina Monaſt. Ord.</note> 
               <hi>Nec mihi,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>diſpenſationem Romani Pontificis objicias, quam niſi Deus appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, te minimè excuſabit, Non omnia Deo placent, quae per ſummum Pontificem in terra geruntur.</hi> Many now a days, cry out againſt the <hi>Commendum,</hi> who never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs countenance by their example, the Simony of Reſignations <hi>in favorem.</hi> We do not find that they reſign their Benefices into the hands of Ordinaries, to be by them diſpoſed of after a lawful and Canonical way. Men are ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to this evil, that they don't think it is an evil, it is grown ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54276:128"/>In the mean time, ſince theſe Reſignations <hi>in favorem</hi> are Odious, and that they are prejudicial to the Rights of Ordinaries and Eccleſiaſtical Patrons, many Regulations have been made to limit them.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, the Regulation which is called <hi>de viginti diebus</hi> has been renewed in reſpect of them;<note place="margin">Regulations that derogate from Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</note> and this was made to hinder Benefices from becoming Hereditary. That Regulation is at preſent called, <hi>de infirmis Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantibus.</hi> And it bears, that if a ſick perſon who reſigns his Benefice, die within twenty days, the Benefice is vacant by death, and therefore the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation made upon ſuch a Reſignation is null, but that Regulation is at preſent uſeleſs, becauſe the Popes daily dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from it in prejudice of Ordinaries. None but Cardinals by virtue of their Priviledges, and ſome perſons of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to whom the Pope grants the like indulgences, enjoy the benefit of the Regulation <hi>de</hi> 20. <hi>diebus,</hi> as well in reſpect of thoſe that are in health, as of the ſick. In the Second place, there is another Regulation which is called <hi>de publicandis Reſignationibus</hi> which is
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:54276:128"/>in force in <hi>France,</hi> and hath been made to prevent Benefices from becoming Hereditary. By that Regulation the Reſignee is obliged to publiſh his Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation within the ſpace of ſix Months; &amp; if within that time he take not Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Benefice, and the Reſigner die, the Benefice is vacant <hi>per obitum.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Right of the Reſignee does not preſcribe till after three years, whil'ſt the Reſigner is alive, and he hath all that time for taking poſſeſſion of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that hath been reſigned to him. In the third place, there are many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions required to make a Reſignation <hi>in favorem</hi> valid. Seeing they cannot be admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted but by the Pope, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made but by Proxy. And that the Procuration may be good, it ought to be made before an approved Notary, whether Apoſtolical or Royal, and ſigned by two Witneſſes. It ought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides to be ſpecial, and for ſuch a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice: And if it take not effect within a year, it is preſumed to be revoked. The Reſigner may alſo revoke his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation before it hath taken Effect, and that Revocation ought to be legally intimated to the Reſignee, or to the Proxy.</p>
            <pb n="242" facs="tcp:54276:129"/>
            <p>There are alſo ſome certain Caſes,<note place="margin">Of Regreſs.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Reſigner may re-enter into his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, by a way which is called <hi>Regreſs.</hi> It is not eaſy to determine when the Regreſs ought to take place: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Courts of Juſtice diſſer much amongſt themſelves in the Judgments they pronounce about that matter; and many times one and the ſame Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament varies as to the matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. In that caſe Equity is more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved than the Rigour of Juſtice: For it is commonly thought the ſick perſon hath made a tacit Compact with him to whom he hath reſigned his Benefice, that his Reſignation ſhall be null, in caſe he recover his health. Seeing that Compact looks very much like confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it is thought to produce a kind of natural obligation, and that the Reſignee ought to be condemned as a perfidious perſon. Upon that principle the Parliament of <hi>Normandy</hi> inſiſted not long ſince, in deciding a difference that happened betwixt two Church-men concerning the Cure of holy Croſs in <hi>Rouen.</hi> The Reſigner Recovering his health would have entred again into his Benefice at the deſire of his Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:54276:129"/>who ſollicited him. On the other hand the Reſignee had taken Poſſeſſion of the Cure, by virtue of his Legal Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from <hi>Rome</hi> upon the Reſignation. Nevertheleſs the Reſignee was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his Poſſeſſion, and it was Judged that Regreſs ought to take place in that caſe. Perhaps it would be more convenient to aſſign an Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Annuity to him that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his Benefice, than ſo eaſily to admit Regreſs. At leaſt they ought not to take place, when the Reſigners reſerve to themſelves an Annuity. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, by countenancing Regreſs, Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations <hi>in favorem</hi> are alſo countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, which are odious, &amp; Simoniacal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many would not reſign their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, if they did not hope to enter again by way of Regreſs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Regreſs ought not to be granted but very rarely, and for weighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for inſtance, becauſe of Nonage; It being to be preſumed that when a Beneficiary who is under age, reſigns his Benefice without the conſent of his Father or <hi>Guardian,</hi> he hath been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to do it by ſome trick So that Regreſs then takes place, and the Minor
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:54276:130"/>is reſtored to his Benefice without any New Collation.</p>
            <p>There is another kind of Reſignation <hi>in favorem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of Exchange.</note> which is called Permuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Exchange, and is likewiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Right of Ordinaries, and more to that of Patrons: It is in the Ordinaries power, nevertheleſs to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or reject them, that depending on him. He ought never to allow Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges unleſs for lawful and Canonical reaſons: But ſo great is the corruption now a days in Beneficial matters, that nothing occurs oftener than inſtances of Exchanges without any cauſe; and Biſhops grant them eaſily, when Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are in Patronage, and they confer them not in full Right. Permutation, then, is nothing elſe but the Exchange of one Benefice for another, made in the hands of the Superiour: And ſeeing it is ſuppoſed to be made for true reaſons, and that by conſequent there is no Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in the caſe, it may be admitted by the Ordinary's, in as much as there is no need of a Diſpenſation. To the end an Exchange may be valid, the Exchangers muſt reſign their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the hands of the Ordinary
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:54276:130"/>or Ordinaries, if they be of different Dioceſes, and the Ordinary gives them New Collations, according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, for he is bound, and cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Benefices, but in favours of the Exchangers. If he doth it the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are null, and each continues in his Benefice. Beſides, they muſt mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually take Poſſeſſion of the Benefices, otherwiſe nothing is done, and things remain as they were before. If one onely of the Exchangers had taken Poſſeſſion, and the other die, the Benefice of him that dies is vacant <hi>per obitum,</hi> and the other keeps his Benefice, becauſe the Exchange was not compleated. This hath been appointed by the New Ordinances and the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of inſinuations, to prevent a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order that was much in uſe. For it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened very often, that a Beneficiary being ready to die, exchanged his Benefice with another Beneficiary, and the latter took Poſſeſſion of his Benefice with whom he had exchanged; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Permutation was accompliſhed on his part, ſo that the Benefice belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him: Afterward the ſick perſon dying without having taken Poſſeſſion of the Benefice that was given him in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:54276:131"/>Exchange, the ſurviver kept his former Benefice; and ſo he enjoyed two at the ſame time, by that fetch which Mr. <hi>Charles du Moulin,</hi> in his Commentary upon the Regulation <hi>de publicandis,</hi> calls <hi>ſpeciem furti.</hi> Nevertheleſs the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice continued long after him in the Parliaments, and that was called <hi>gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere de bona fortuna.</hi> But the New Ordinances have reformed that abuſe, and there is no more now of <hi>gaudeat de bona fortuna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The frequent Unions of Benefices,<note place="margin">Of Unions.</note> which were made in the times of Schiſm and diſorder, have alſo done great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to Ordinary Collators, and to the Pope himſelf, becauſe by that means many Titles have been ſuppreſſed. They have nevertheleſs been profitable to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Chapters, who have made uſe of theſe occaſions for uniting to their Benefices, inferiour Livings &amp; Cures: But theſe kinds of Unions are not now in uſe, unleſs it be ſometimes in favour of Communities who enjoy by that means ſeveral Benefices: yet there is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care taken of that at preſent, than there was in times paſt; and if it were not well lookt after, a great part of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices would fall into the hands of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:54276:131"/>Regular and Secular Communities: Which would be very prejudicial to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators and Patrons, and even to private Church-men, who can no longer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Benefices which are united in that manner. I ſpeak not here of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Unions, or at leaſt, of ſuch as are uſeful to the Church; for theſe Unions ſtill ſubſiſt. If, for inſtance, a Priory or Chappel is ſo ruined, that it is impoſſible to reſtore it; what remains of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue ought to be united to another Church: If the Prebends of a Chapter or Collegiat Church are too ſmall, ſeveral of them muſt be joined together: If in a Town or Burrough there be too many Cures, and they but poor, it is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to ſuppreſs ſome of them, and give the Revenue to others. In the ſame manner a ſimple Benefice may be joined to a poor cure; &amp;, in a word, Monaſteries where the Rule hath ceaſed, may be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a Biſhoprick that hath not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Revenue: But in all theſe Unions the advantage of the Church is always to be regarded, and the Rights of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours maintained; otherwiſe they are abuſive. And therefore Unions are not to be made but upon good and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary information. The Biſhop hath
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:54276:132"/>Right to make theſe Unions, unleſs it be when the Union is to be made to his own Church, becauſe then he cannot be Judge in his own caſe. Moreover the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Biſhopricks is reſerved to the Pope.</p>
            <p>Though Reverſions have been aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dults or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Members of Parliament.</note> yet there are in <hi>France</hi> Priviledges of the Members of Parliament, and the degrees of thoſe who have ſtudied a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time in the Famous Univerſities of the Kingdom, which are a kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, and by conſequent are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Rights of Ordinary Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, &amp; of Eccleſiaſtical Patrons. I ſhall not ſpeak here of the Original of theſe Priviledges. Only we may obſerve, that during the time of Schiſm, Popes granted thoſe favours to Princes, to great men that were powerful in the Courts of Princes, and to ſuch as might be a hinderance to them in their ſettlement in the Papacy. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath aboliſhed <hi>Indults</hi> as well as Apoſtolical <hi>Mandats.</hi> But ſince its deciſions are not received in <hi>France,</hi> the Priviledges of the Members of Parliament have been ſtill retained. To the end a Priviledge whereof we are ſpeaking may have its effect, Letters muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from the King, commanding the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:54276:132"/>Ordinary Collator, to confer on him who hath the Priviledge the firſt vacant Benefice of his Collation. Beſides, theſe Letters muſt be intimated before the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of the Benefice: and then the hands of the Collator are tied. The <hi>Indultee</hi> or Priviledged perſon hath ſix Months to require the Benefice in, and the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator can be charged but with one Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge during his life: or if it be a Community which dieth not, then it is regulated by the life of the King. The Collator, in the mean time, could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly oblige the <hi>Indultee</hi> to accept the firſt vacant Benefice, provided it were worth 200 Francs, becauſe the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is <hi>de beneficio proximè vacaturo.</hi> But he cannot at preſent be obliged to it, unleſs it be worth 600 Francs of yearly Rent. In the number of <hi>Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Graces,</hi> or Reverſions, may alſo be reckoned the Kings nomination for his happy coming to the Crown, and his nomination for the Oath of Allegiance, which gives him Right to nominate to the New Biſhop after the Concluſion of the <hi>Regale,</hi> one for the firſt vacant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend.<note place="margin">Of Degrees.</note>

            <p>The complaints of the Univerſity of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:54276:133"/>
               <hi>Paris</hi> againſt the Biſhops, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly beſtowed Benefices on their Domeſticks and undeſerving perſons, were the cauſe that in the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> it was decreed, That the third part of Benefices ſhould be ſet apart for the Graduats of Famous Univerſities, and that if the Ordinaries gave them to others, their Collations ſhould be null. The Pragmatick made in the aſſembly of <hi>Bourges,</hi> ratified that decree of the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> but with this qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that the third deſtin'd for Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duats ſhould be divided into three parts, and that two thirds of that third ſhould be appropriated to thoſe who had ſome notable employment in the Univerſity. And therefore it was ordered by the ſame Aſſembly, that the Univerſity ſhould name thoſe whom they would have preferred. And thence ariſes the diſtinction of ſimple Graduats, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duats named. The Concordat hath preſerved that Right of Graduats: But becauſe fraud might be committed in the third of Benefices which were given in courſe one after another, they had four Months of the year allotted to them, to wit, <hi>January, April, July,</hi> and <hi>October,</hi>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:54276:133"/>and the Benefices that fall during theſe four Months are appropriated to them. <hi>January</hi> and <hi>July</hi> are called Months of Rigour, becauſe the Collator or Patron is obliged to give the vacant Benefice to the Graduat named, who is the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteſt, and hath moſt Right; whereas in the other two Months which are called Months of favour, he is free to give the vacant Benefices, to ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled Graduats as he pleaſes. To be a Graduate, it is enough that one hath ſtudied two years Philoſophy, three years Divinity, and taken the degree of Maſter of Arts. Yet this hinders not but that their Batchelour Graduats, Doctor Graduats, Graduats, in Divinity, the Canon Law and Medicine, to whom alſo there is a certain time aſſigned; and in caſe of competition the moſt qualified Graduate is preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other, though it be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pretty hard to know who ought to be preferred. That this Right may take effect, the Letters of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, Atteſtations of the time of Study and the Univerſities Letters of Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt be ſignified to the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Patron or Collator. And becauſe
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:54276:134"/>Gentlemen have ſome Priviledge as to the time of Study, they ought likewiſe to produce the proofs of their quality. Of all theſe Inſtruments and Acts the Patron or Collator ought to keep a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. They are beſides obliged every year in <hi>Lent</hi> to renew the Regiſter of their names, which they may do in the Office of the Eccleſiaſtical Regiſter. When a Benefice falls in the Months that are appropriated to them, they ought to demand it within ſix Months; and that being expired they are no longer admitted to make their Requiſition. If the Pope prevent them before they have made their demand, he that hath been provided by the Pope obtains the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice; And there is no need that the Pope ſhould even mention that the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is deſtined to Graduats, becauſe he is not tied to the Law that is in <hi>France</hi> in favours of Graduats. But the Ordinary ought to ſpecify in his Collations the quality of the Graduat, which is the cauſe for which he gives the Benefice. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he may ſtill put queſtions to the Graduats, though heretofore they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be exempted from examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the eaſineſs of obtaining De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:54276:134"/>makes, that there are to be found many ignorant &amp; vicious Graduats. And therefore the Collator, and even the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, have always right to refuſe them, if they judge them uncapable of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices which they have demanded.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerved that all ſorts of Benefices are not Subject to Graduats I. Conſiſtorial Benefices and ſuch as are in Lay-Patronage are exempted. II. The dignities of Cathedral Churches; but amongſt theſe dignities the Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary is not reckoned; and there is ſome difficulty alſo as to the Divinity Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, though there be Judgments as to that in favours of Graduats. III. The right of Graduats has no place but when the Benefices are vacant by death. IV. When the Graduate hath a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of 400 Francs a year, or an Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the ſame value, which ſtands him inſtead of a Benefice, he is thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and cannot pretend to any Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in quality of a Graduate, unleſs he had not that Proviſion by virtue of his degrees; for in that caſe he may renounce his Benefice or Annuity, and have right as before, to demand the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefics. appropriated to Graduats. The
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54276:135"/>reaſon why a Graduat having a Benefice of 400 Francs is reckoned provided is, that in the Concordat 200 Florins are mentioned, which have been valued at, 400 Francs: But I think, at preſent they ought to be valued at 600. V. When the Benefice that falls in the the month of Graduats is under Rule, it cannot be demanded but by a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Graduat Juſt ſo, the Regular can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not demand Secular Benefices. VI. In fine, if an <hi>Indultee</hi> or Priviledged perſon, and a Graduat, demand one and the ſame Benefice, the <hi>Indultee</hi> is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the Graduat.</p>
            <p>The Exemptions which Popes have granted to ſeveral Churches,<note place="margin">Of Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> as well Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular as Secular, have alſo much deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Canonical Right of Biſhops, becauſe Abbots and other Patrons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in full Right the Benefices which are contained in their Exemptions; and they failing, the Right is devolved on the Pope, who is become their immediat Superiour. This is not a proper place to handle theſe exemptions to the full, nor to ſpeak of their Original; beſides, we have elſewhere ſaid ſomewhat as to that Subject. I ſhall only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54276:135"/>what relates to the Cuſtom of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>I. The Decree of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> that derogats from Exemptions is not received there; But the Titles, on which the Exemptions are founded, are exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; and if the Titles be lawful, the Priviledges that are expreſſed are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</item>
               <item>II. Poſſeſſion alone is not enough to authoriſe theſe Priviledges: Legal Titles muſt alſo be produced, in as much as many are in Poſſeſſion of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, becauſe their Titles have not been ſufficiently examined, which moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are falſe and it is not Juſt that Exemption, which is but a Priviledged Right, ſhould prejudice the common Right of Biſhops, unleſs it be well grounded, and granted for lawful cauſes: To this may be added, that<note n="(1)" place="margin">Fraus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini debet Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trocinari.</note> [fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood can never make a Preſcription, and that a Poſſeſſion grounded on a bad Title, is no true Poſſeſſion. All poſſible rigour ought to be uſed then againſt the Right of Exemption or Priviledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it derogates from the Common Law; and nothing ſhould be granted to the exempted, but what is expreſly ſet
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54276:136"/>down in their Title of Exemption: And it is abſolutely neceſſary that the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges be mentioned in plain Terms, without any ambiguity.</item>
               <item>III. The more ancient the Titles of Exemption are, of the leſs extent are the Priviledges of the Exemptions, as appears by Ancient Formularies, which hardly contain any thing elſe in reſpect of Monaſteries, but the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of chuſing the Abbot, and the free Diſpoſition of all their Revenues; as to the reſt they were entirely Subject to the Biſhops.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Exemptions, as we find them now a days, began only with the Reformations of <hi>Cluni</hi> and <hi>Ciſteaux,</hi> who were exempted from the Juriſdiction of Biſhops by the Title of their Foundation. Though that happened in a diſorderly time, yet theſe Exemptions are not medled with in <hi>France,</hi> ſeeing they are owned by all men. But there is great cauſe to doubt of the moſt part of others, which are ſuppoſed to have been granted by Popes after the Foundation of Monaſteries. There are but few of them that are true in their full extent, which is eaſily diſcovered when one ſets
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:54276:136"/>ſeriouſly to work to examin the Titles: And in that manner <hi>Peter de Blois</hi> Arch Deacon of the Church of <hi>Bath</hi> in <hi>England</hi> affirms, that the Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Monaſteries in his time were examined, of which the greateſt part were forged by the Monks. The Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> thought the Letters of Exemption of the Abbey of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> to be falſe, <hi>quia in filo &amp; Bulla vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur vitioſae, ſtilumque Romanae curiae minime redolebant.</hi> Nevertheleſs the Abbot refuſing to ſubmit to his Biſhop, fell into ſuch a rage againſt him, that the ſame <hi>Peter de Blois</hi> complained of it in his letter<note n="(1)" place="margin">Petr. Blaeſ. Epiſt. <hi>68.</hi>
               </note> to Pope <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. To whom, upon occaſion of the Abbot of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> he repreſents the abuſes of Exemptions; take it in his own words: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iles ſunt Abbates &amp; miſeri qui poteſtatem Epiſcoporum non exterminant, cum pro annua Auri uncia plenam à ſede Romanâ poſſint aſſequi li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatem.</hi> By this it is apparent enough, that Monaſteries obtained for Money from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as many Exemptions as they pleaſed, and that Simony was much practiſed by the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:54276:137"/>Monks, eſpecially the Regular Abbots, who by that means ſhook off Obedience to their Biſhops, that they might more freely ſquander away the Revenues of their Monaſteries, and have no Body to check them for their vices.<note n="(1)" place="margin">Petr. Blaeſ. ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Deteſtantur Abbates, habere ſuorum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſuum correctorem, vagam impunitatis licentiam amplectuntur, clauſtraliſque militiae jugum relaxant in omnem deſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii libertatem. Hinc eſt quod monaſterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum fere omnium facultates datae ſunt in direptienem &amp; praedam.</hi> Theſe and many other reaſons which I omit, are the cauſe that no great favour is ſhewn to the Exemptions of Monaſteries in <hi>France,</hi> though they be not wholly rejected there: To which may be added, that many of theſe Exemptions, eſpecially thoſe of Chapters, have been obtained in the times of Schiſm; and it often happened, that the Chapter which oppoſed its Biſhop, acknowledged one Pope, and the Biſhop another. And that is to be taken notice of in the Titles of Exemptions,<note place="margin">Rules how to diſtinguiſh true Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from falſe.</note> that what was done upon occaſion of Schiſm may not be authoriſed.</p>
            <p>That true Titles may be the more
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:54276:137"/>eaſily diſtinguiſhed from ſuch as have been foiſted and counterfeited, we ſhall here ſet down ſeveral Rules, which are neceſſary to be known, if one would with any exactneſs make that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: And that will not only ſerve to diſcover the falſity of Priviledges and Exemptions, but alſo to Judge of other Titles.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. One muſt have ſeen true Titles that are paſt all exception, according to which are to be examined thoſe that are produced. The Characters are to be minded if it be an Original Piece; for it ſeldom happens, that they who coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Titles, do exactly imitate theſe Characters, whether it be that they write too haſtily, or that they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied to do ſomewhat that comes near them, but which is not altogether like.</item>
               <item>II. The difference of ſtile that occurs betwixt true pieces and counterfeit, is very uſeful for diſtinguiſhing the one from the other: for inſtance, one muſt know in what manner Princes in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent times began their Letters, and how they finiſhed them; for it is certain, the ſtile hath not been always the ſame.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:54276:138"/>Beſides, they have alſo expreſied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in different manners in ſeveral times, as to the Body and Contents of their Letters.</item>
               <item>III. The way of dating Letters hath much varied; and that is a thing that hath not been always minded by thoſe who have counterfeited falſe I rivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: They have for moſt part, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Cuſtom of their times.</item>
               <item>IV. Chronology and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Writing or Deed are to be minded, examining if they who have ſubſcribed it lived all in that time, and if they could probably be all together in the place ſpoken of; or if the matters of fact reported ſuit with the Cuſtoms and Practice of thoſe times.</item>
               <item>V. One muſt not be ignorant of the time when certain ways of ſpeaking began to be in uſe. For it is eaſily perceived that a Piece is New, when it contains New terms and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</item>
               <item>VI. It is neceſſary to be acquainted with Hiſtory and eſpecially what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Rights of Popes, to know whether the Writing do not attribute
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:54276:138"/>to the Pope who grants the Priviledged ſome Rights which he did not as yet enjoy: And that happens commonly in Ancient Priviledges, becauſe they who have counterfeited them, have ſqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>red themſelves according to their own times, and not the times of the Popes whoſe names they have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed</item>
               <item>VII. One ought to know Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology, Hiſtory, the manner of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and dating of Writings, the diverſity of Stile and of Subſcriptions, not only in reſpect of different Times, but alſo of different Places and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: For it is certain, that theſe things have varied according to the diverſity of Places and Perſons. Princes do not always agree in that with Popes and Biſhops; and Princes differ alſo among themſelves. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the manner of beginning the year hath not been uniform in all places, nor in all times, Dates and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions are very different according to the diverſity of Places and Perſons. And that has made thoſe who have been ignorant of thoſe different Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, fall into ſuch groſs faults, that
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:54276:139"/>the falſity of the Deeds which they have counterfeited ſtares in ones face.</item>
               <item>VIII. There is nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon than to ſee counterfeit Marks or Monograms. And therefore it is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to have true ones, to make a diſtinction of the real from the falſe; which is alſo to be obſerved in Seals, that have been often counterfeited. It muſt not, for all that, be concluded that a Deed is good, becauſe nothing ſeems wanting to the Subſcription, nor to the Seal: For there was nothing more eaſy heretofore than to remove the Seal from one Deed to another. Seeing the Seal was faſtened to the Parchment, and that there was no Counter-Seal, the Seal was eaſily taken off without hurting the Impreſſion, by heating the Parchment a little. It is true in after times that falſiſication was remedied by means of a Counter-Seal, and a little ſtring that tied the Seal to the Parchment: But for all the care that could be taken it is impoſſible alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to prevent falſification. There is nothing more eaſy than to keep the Subſcription and Seal entire, and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:54276:139"/>with ſome Waters or Eſſences to waſh out all the writing, and to ſuppoſe another Title in what manner one pleaſes. The reality then of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and Seal is not a ſufficient proof; but it will be convenient alſo to conſider, whether the Parchment has not received ſome alteration, or whether the Ink be not too new; or different from that wherewith the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription has been made.</item>
               <item>IX. The counterfeiting of a Deed hath ſometimes been found out by the newneſs of the Parchment, that had ſome Mark to make it known by. On the contrary, they who have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to have Titles too Ancient, and have for that end written their Priviledges on the Barks of Trees, have rendered themſelves ridiculous, becauſe it is eaſy to be made out, that at that time when they are ſuppoſed to have been written, there was no uſe made of the rind of Trees, at leaſt in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>X. They alſo who have joined many dates together, thinking thereby to render their Titles more Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, marking the years of Princes and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:54276:140"/>Emperours with the Indictions and ſuch other things as were contrary to the Cuſtom of the places and times wherein they lived, thought to have impoſed on others by an odd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable exactneſs.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Did I not fear to be too tedious, I would give inſtances for confirmation of all theſe Rules: But that deſerves a ſeparate work. I ſhall only add ſome Remarks concerning Cartularies, becauſe I perceive men too credulouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, and mind not, that part of the Titles which are contained in Cartularies, are either falſe or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cartularies</hi> are the Rolls or Regiſters of Churches or Monaſteries,<note place="margin">Of what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority are <hi>Cartularies.</hi>
               </note> wherein are recorded the Contracts of Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Selling, Exchange, Priviledges, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, Exemptions and other Deeds and Charters. Theſe <hi>Cartularies,</hi> are long poſteriour to moſt part of the Acts contained in them, and they are only made for preſervation of the Acts, and that Poſterity may have recourſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to them. But there are ſtrong reaſons to doubt of the fidelity of thoſe who have compiled the <hi>Cartularies,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:54276:140"/>a vaſt Number of falſe or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Titles are to be found in them.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, ſeeing in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Cuſtom of writing Titles, or Acts of Foundations, and Immunities or Priviledges, was not as yet intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, the Compilers of <hi>Cartularies</hi> who ſaw that they enjoyed ſeveral Lands, and that they were in Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome Priviledges, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Titles for them, have not failed to make, and to inſert them in their <hi>Cartularies.</hi> I believe it is for that reaſon, that the Titles which are in the <hi>Cartularies,</hi> attributed to the Kings of <hi>France</hi> of the firſt Race, are almoſt all falſe; and for the ſame reaſon alſo, we ought to miſtruſt the Primitive Exemptions, which are the more to be ſuſpected, that they appear the more Ancient. The Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits that Biſhops have had with the Abbots of Monaſteries, have alſo much contributed to the Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of falſe Titles: For to back their ſeveral cauſes, they ſpared no pains in falſifying of Deeds.</p>
            <p>In the Second place, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54276:141"/>of <hi>Cartularies</hi> have not always inſerted the acts as they were in the Original Writing: Which is eaſily proved by comparing the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals with the Copies that are Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the <hi>Cartularies,</hi> or even by comparing Ancient <hi>Cartularies,</hi> with others more Modern; for the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are, of the greater extent they are. We find, for inſtance, the Foundation of the Monaſtery of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaure,</hi> otherwiſe called of St. <hi>Clement,</hi> in the<note n="(1)" place="margin">Ital. Sacr. Tom. <hi>6.</hi>
               </note> ſixth Volume of the Hiſtory of the Biſhops of <hi>Italy,</hi> and in the Title of that Foundation, ſome Charters of Immunities, Priviledges, and Exemptions are mentioned. But theſe acts agree not for moſt part with other Copies that are inſerted in a more Ancient <hi>Cartu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi> of the ſame Monaſtery. And, which is obſervable, in the Printed Copy, which without doubt hath been taken out of a later Manuſcript, there is an enumeration of many Lands belonging to the Monaſtery of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaure,</hi> as may be ſeen in the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which bears this Title<note n="(2)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> page 1308.</note>

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54276:141"/>Sancti Clementis in Piſcaria, Anno Domini.</hi> 875. But in the Manuſcript <hi>Cartulary</hi> which I have read, there is nothing to be found of that long liſt of Lands and Poſſeſſions: They are only named in it in general, and not in particular. Beſides, theſe words of the date which are in the Printed are not in the Manuſcript <hi>Cartulary, Anno Dominicae Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis.</hi> 875. Becauſe the Emperours at that time made no mention in their Letters of the year of our Lord. The ſame Catalogue of Lands and Poſſeſſions that is to be found in the Printed Priviledge of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Louis,</hi> is to be found alſo in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Priviledge granted by <hi>Roger King</hi> of <hi>Sicily</hi> to the ſame Monaſtery. But the Ancient Manuſcript <hi>Cartulary</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains nothing of that liſt: Whence it is to be inferred, that the Monks have made no ſcruple to Regiſter in their <hi>Cartularies,</hi> Titles in a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent way from what they were in their Originals. The ſame hath alſo happened to the Priviledges of Popes which are in the ſame <hi>Cartulary:</hi> For there are ſome things in the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:54276:142"/>Printed Copies, that are not to be found in the Manuſcript Acts, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others the Priviledge attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>Leo</hi> IX. is ſhorter in the Manuſcript, than in Print, for the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Copy only ends with this clauſe;<note n="(1)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> page 1311.</note> 
               <hi>Quoniam ſcriptum eſt, terminos patrum noſtrorum nulla authoritate illicitae temeritatis tranſgredi prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumi, &amp; quia opportunitatis exigit ratio propter vos &amp; tranſgreſſores Canonicae correctionis debere fraeno conſtringi, illius inſuper ſpirituali baculo perdat animum, cujus temporali gladio Malchus amiſit auriculam: Qui autem obſervator ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titerit, ditetur dono Apoſtolicae bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionis, &amp;c.</hi> There is not a word of all this in the ſame Priviledge, as it is inſerted in the Manuſcript <hi>Cartulary.</hi> Many other inſtances might be brought of the great liberty that the Compilers of Cartularies have taken in tranſcribing Originals, and even the Copies of their Titles; and by conſequent they are not much to be credited.</p>
            <p>It is eaſy to be Collected from what hath been ſaid,<note place="margin">A diſtinction betwixt falſe Titles, and falſified Titles.</note> that a Title is not altogether falſe, though there be falſities in it. Yet I think theſe kinds of Deeds
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:54276:142"/>ought entirely to be rejected, for the leaſt falſity that occurs in them, becauſe falſaries ſhould never be countenanced in any thing, and that the Exemptions whereof we ſpeak are odious and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Canon Law. It is then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, that they who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be exempted ſhould produce good Originals to prove their Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, at leaſt that theſe Falſities be not to be found in the Acts that have been approved by Princes or other Superiour Powers; and after all, they ought to be very carefully examined. That we may know the nature of Acts, it is to be obſerved, that Monaſteries have ſometimes got their Titles and Priviledges confirmed by Princes and other Superiours, upon Information that the Ancient Titles were ſo old and worn out, that it was hard to read them; and then others were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in place of the Ancient. Theſe Renovations were not always very ſincere: For the Old writings were ſometimes forged, and beſides they added things that ſuited not with the times of thoſe who were pretended to have granted the Ancient Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:54276:143"/>But ſince he who had power to grant Priviledges himſelf, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, they could not be accuſed of falſity, unleſs there was ſurpriſe in the caſe, and that lies had been alledged in the Petition; becauſe it is a general Maxim, that every Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Supplication ought to be grounded on truth. After all, theſe Priviledges which are ſaid to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in place of others more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, are not eaſily to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: For that would be to open a door to a great deal of Forgery; And Beſides, a Title cannot be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in place of another, by way of renewing and confirmation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the latter make mention of the former, and that it be expreſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that that laſt Priviledge hath only been given in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ancient. And thus you have in a few words the Principal Rules that are to be obſerved in the Examination of Titles, which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries and other Churches that pretend to be Exempted or Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, produce for Juſtifying their Exemptions and Immunities. Many
